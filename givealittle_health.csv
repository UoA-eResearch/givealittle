Lachie Love needs your help!,Lachie has an extremely rare and aggressive brain tumour. Help us to do everything we can for him in the precious time that we have left.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/b211bd87-2129-455e-8d54-af82009f6b15-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/lachie-needs-your-help,131736.99,0.0,160 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/lachie-needs-your-help,6 Jan 2023,11 Dec 2024,5,Auckland,1554,"Lachie is 8. He has a sparkle in his eyes & an overflowing personality. He is “big” in every sense of the word – full of energy, love & life.
On December 29, Lachie was diagnosed with a brain tumour that was later confirmed as DIPG. This is about the worst news any parent could hear: DIPG is an extremely rare, aggressive & lethal tumour, with an average life expectancy of less than a year.
https://dipg.org/dipg-facts/what-is-dipg/
Lachie is the son of Liesje & Andy Love & Harry’s big brother. He is a grandson to Emma & Bruce Donkin, grandson to Carole & Michael Love, nephew to Nikki Donkin, James & Erin Donkin, Grant & Philippa Love & John & Josie Love, a cousin, great grandson & friend to many. It is incomprehensible to think of our world without his big smile & big hugs.
The immediate future will be grueling. The financial toll will be huge, as Liesje & Andy are self-employed & can't rely on sick leave or employer support. We hope that this page will mitigate some of the financial stress & allow Lachie to explore all available treatment options, including any clinical trials. At the very least, we want Lachie to tick off some bucket list items while he still can.
We know that people want to help, but there is very little that can be done in a practical sense. If you do want to contribute via this page, then it would be a little something positive for Lachie & his family in the most horrendous of circumstances. Your support is hugely appreciated.

31 May 2024
Hey everyone, long time no update! Lachie is doing quite well given the circumstances. His latest MRI showed the tumour is stable which is amazing, we're so grateful for all this extra time we're getting with him. The oncologist told Liesje & Andy to book another holiday and make as many memories as they can, so they're looking at getting to Melbourne at the end of June to take Lach to the Harry Potter Hidden Forrest exhibition, among other things.
Liesje's good friend Nikki is running a marathon in November, and Auntie E is running one in September, to try and help raise funds for his Melbourne trip, which is amazing, you can follow their updates over at Nikki's page - https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/a-marathon-for-lachie-loves-bucket-list - go ladies!!
As always, thanks again for all your love and support, it's such a dark path to be walking but having you all behind us really does help!

Dear Santa....
11 December 2023
Merry Christmas to all of you who have followed us on this journey and supported our family. It's been a while since an update, so I'll start with some good news. Lachie had an MRI a couple of weeks back which showed the tumour has shrunk a little bit again, so something seems to be working with the supplements he's on! He's working hard at private physio and making progress with being able to take a few steps again, which is amazing to see. Unfortunately he's also having some big emotions and behaviours (who can blame him, he just wants to be a normal kid!), which has resulted in another smashed TV (TV number 3?).
Lachie turns 9 on Sunday, a milestone we weren't sure he'd hit, so we'll be celebrating with all his friends and family in some way that Lachie can participate in, which I'm sure will involve Nerf Guns!
We're coming up on 12 months since this nightmare began, and we're extremely grateful for all the time we get with him, considering that the average life expectancy is 9 months. 12 months off work for Andy to take care of Lachie full time would certainly have taken a higher toll financially if it weren't for all your generous donations, so once again thank you so much for your support!
I hope everyone has a happy holiday period, enjoy time with your loved ones!

Make-A-Wish Party
31 July 2023
Hello everyone!
Time for a quick update. Lachie is doing reasonably well, staying out of hospital and able to get out and about to do a few things.
On Friday we had his Make-A-Wish party through the Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Zealand. He wanted a big party will all of his friends and family, so we all descended on Arena Albany for arcade games, slushies, pizzas, inflatable obstacle course and Nerf Wars! He's always loved Nerf Guns, and was super excited to hear he got to keep all of the guns! This is still something he regularly does, often using his Opa as target practice!
He's working hard at physio to get more mobility, and recently acquired a walker to give him a bit more independence. At this stage there is no further treatment plan.
Everyone knows the old saying ""when it rains it pours"", and unfortunately Liesje & Andy have been hit with something new to stress about. Their mortgage has always been with HSBC who have now withdrawn from the NZ Market, meaning they need to remortgage at a much higher rate, however, the renovations on the house aren't complete, meaning no CCC, Andy isn't working as he's full time carer for Lachie and Liesje is working less to spend time with him. There's also 'unusual' spending for bucket list items and extra medical expenses like private physio so they can't get a new lender. If anyone has any tips, please let us know!
Once again we're extremely grateful for your support!
Nikki

Another kick in the guts
20 June 2023
Hello everyone,
Time for another update, which is one we were hoping not to write. Despite Lachie being on a diet to bring his liver enzymes down, and Liesje & Andy doing everything they possibly can to get Lachie onto the chemo trial, it wasn't enough. His liver enzymes are still too high, therefore, he isn't able to participate in the PNOC022 trial. So for now, his next follow up at Starship is in mid August, unless he needs to go in earlier.
We can explore importing the meds from Germany, but our oncologist won’t support this unless liver enzymes are normal. This is around $10k per month to import and also thought to be less effective than the trial drugs (which are two).
If we go down the German route, then we won’t qualify for the third part of the trial which we may qualify for once there is progression (signs the tumour is growing). However, once we have progression, there may not be any slots left on the trial. So we may choose not not to get the drugs from German in favour of the thought to be more effective combo, only to find out we can’t be on it anywhere.
So for now we carry on as is. No more scheduled visits to Starship but we will continue with private physio and plan some more adventures.
Lachie is very pleased to not have any more bloods and the liver detoxify diet was loosened today as a reward… as you can see from the photo below he embraced it.
Thank you again for your continued support!

A bumpy ride, but finally a bit of good news
2 June 2023
Hello everyone,
We've been a bit quiet with updates while continuing on this journey with Lachie. It's been a rough ride for him, with a 9 day stay in hospital for respiratory issues, as well as losing all of his speech and mobility for a while. He's slowly been able to regain his speech again, with most of it able to be understood. He's also starting to be able to sit himself up again and much more controlled movement of his arms/hands, which is really good to see. He's even felt well enough to go in to school to see his friends and teachers while dropping Harry off for the day.
Amazingly, his latest MRI has shown that the tumour has shrunk by 1cm on one side and .5cm on the other side - something we didn't expect due to the decline in his mobility etc! This means he qualifies to start the chemo trial next month, with the only thing standing in the way being his liver enzymes are too high. He's come off the steroids now and we are seeing a decline in those on his weekly bloodtests, so fingers crossed they come down enough!
A spa is being set up at home for him to relax in to help with his muscle pains - water has always been his happy place.
Thank you again for all the continued support!!
Nikki

I am so glad to see some improvement I hope you keep strong .
There is always some hope. I have been through this journey myself & after radiation & cemo my tumour has reduced in size considerably
Update
22 April 2023
Hello to all of Lachie's supporters! It's been a while since I've posted an update.
It's been just over a month since radiation finished, and unfortunately it's been a bit of a rough ride for our boy. Lachie hadn't been feeling very well, was very tired and vomiting a lot. He had excess fluid in the brain as a side effect from the radiation, so had a shunt fitted to drain this away to relieve the pressure in his head. It has helped, but it's taken a couple of adjustments to it for it to be working as well as needed.
Lachie's balance and mobility has declined, meaning he is now in a wheelchair and can't walk unassisted. He is also suffering from anxiety, which of course is understandable.
The most recent MRI showed a change in the tumour, but the oncologists believe this to be pseudo progression, meaning still inflammation from the radiation. He's on a high dose of steroids to try and reduce the swelling and hopefully give him some balance and mobility back.
On a positive note, he's been doing some pretty cool things when he's able to - feeding the lemurs at Willowbank Wildlife Reserve, as well as feeding Giraffes and patting rhinos at Orana Wildlife Park. He's had a private screening at Event Cinemas Albany for him and his friends to see the Mario movie, been on a jet boat ride at the Waimakariri River, and had a private flight over the city thanks to Steven Smith from Barfoot & Thompson, to name a few.
We are still hopeful that the steroids will help him gain back some independence and enable him to do a few more things on his bucket list. If you haven't followed his bucket list page on facebook, the link is https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089298321738.
Once again thank you so much for all your donations, they're enabling Liesje and Andy to spend time with Lachie to care for him, but also to make all of these memories possible for the family, for which we are deeply grateful.

He did it!
15 March 2023
Monday marked the last of Lachie's 30 radiotherapy sessions! The team at Auckland Hospital were amazing and patient with him to get him through his journey, which was challenging at times!
Overall Lachie is doing pretty well, enjoying his time doing things he wants to do, and hopefully now that his treatment has finished, he'll be able to go to some different places and tick off some of the bucket list!
For now we have to wait 4 weeks for another MRI to see what effect it has had on the tumour, which seems like an eternity. After that, there is the possibility of a chemo trial which would start in about 12 weeks, which Liesje & Andy are exploring.
Once again thank you for all the love and support for our family, it's truly amazing to feel surrounded by such awesome people who are cheering for Lachie and our family during this journey.

A rough couple of weeks
6 March 2023
Hi everyone, thank you again for your continued love and support for our family!
It's been a rough couple of weeks for Lachie, unfortunately the small doses of steroids didn't help him feel better, and his symptoms of hydrocephalus worsened, putting pressure on his brain.
We tried a larger dose of steroids while he was hospitalized, but unfortunately, this didn't seem to help either. Last week he underwent surgery to have a shunt put into his brain, which drains the fluid build up back down into his stomach. The difference this has made has been huge, even just the next day he was a much happier kid!
We have another 8 sessions of radiation to complete, then a 4 week wait for an MRI to see if it has shrunk the tumour down. Hopefully during this 4 week wait he still feels quite good and can get out and do some fun things.
In the meantime we're enjoying as much time as we can as a family, with his Grandparents from Palmerston North coming to visit to spend some quality time with him.

So sorry to hear Lachie's had a rough couple of weeks and has been feeling poorly, sending love to him and all of your family. We're all praying that the radiation will put paid to that darned tumour and that Lachie can make a miraculous recovery . xxxxxx
Half way!
14 February 2023
Today marked half way through Lachie's radiation treatment, and most of the sessions he's handled like a champ! Fingers crossed the rest of the treatment goes smoothly - he isn't feeling too good at the moment, so we're trying a short does of steroids starting today to see if that makes him more comfortable.
On Friday night we got to spend an awesome VIP evening at Eden Park in the World Cup Lounge for Ed Sheeran, including Limo & Hummer transfers there and back, all courtesy of Eden Park. It was great to tick that off Lachie's bucket list! The NZ Herald did an article yesterday to cover this - https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/ed-sheeran-red-carpet-concert-for-boy-with-incurable-brain-cancer/YL3SQGGUURHQBIJGEP3EOVCDN4/?fbclid=IwAR2-LTXGOOp6CoIuwWRR7-DSKCgmDI0_9VooCLBr--ibB-iVudVtS8Xz5Ak.
I'll update more once we have more to tell - as always, thank you to each and every one of you for your support!

1 week down!
28 January 2023
Yesterday Lachie completed his first week of radiation therapy, and for the most part he was an absolute rockstar with the whole process! He had a bit of difficulty yesterday with it, but eventually did it with no problems. Fingers crossed the rest of the treatment goes smoothly and he doesn't suffer from side effects.
The plan has changed from three weeks of radiation back to six weeks as originally planned, so 25 more sessions to go!
This week he's enjoyed spending time with his cousins and friends, and also been to see the new Avatar movie with Andy.
More adventures are planned for him, which will be documented on his facebook page that I posted in my previous update - please feel free to follow along there as well https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089298321738

Lachie's Adventures
19 January 2023
We are absolutely mind blown by the support for Lachie, Liesje, Andy & Harry, as well as the rest of the family. We never anticipated the level of love & support from people all over the world - friends, family & complete strangers. We can never express the gratitude we have for this, so a big thank you from the bottom of our hearts is all I can offer.
This past week Lachie has been out and about enjoying time with family and friends before treatment starts next week.
He's been horse riding at Muriwai, then off to Rotorua to go zip lining, luging and playing mini golf to name a few.
We have created a facebook page to document all of his adventures, if you'd like to follow along there the link is https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089298321738.
I will also continue to update this page as we continue on this journey.
Much love from our family to you

Mask fitting day!
12 January 2023
Once again, the support we've received for Lachie, Liesje, Andy & Harry, as well as our extended family has been incredible and overwhelming. The outpouring of love from friends/acquaintances & even complete strangers has been amazing. I'd love to go through and thank each and every one of you for your donations/shares/messages, but there are just too many to do this. So from the very bottom of our hearts, we offer our deepest gratitude for every single donation to Lachie's fund, whether it is big or small, we're extremely touched that you've donated to help Lachie live his best life for as long as possible.
We've managed to secure Ed Sheeran tickets for him now, which he's very excited about! Thanks to everyone who sent messages offering their tickets!
Lachie will embark on his radiation journey on the 23rd of January, and Liesje & Andy have opted for the 3 week course at a higher dose, which has the same effect but the side effects are thought to be shorter.
We're hoping this will mean Lachie will be feeling pretty good by the end of February and able to go on some adventures here at home and overseas.
Lachie had his mask fitting today, this is to keep his head in the right place during the radiation therapy.
I will continue to post updates throughout his journey.
Much love from us to you
Nikki

Next Steps
7 January 2023
First of all, on behalf of Liesje, Andy, Lachie & Harry, and our extended family, thank you. We're deeply grateful for all the love and support our family has been shown during the darkest of times, from all over the world. We appreciate all the messages of support and offers of help, and while you may not always get a reply, please know that Liesje & Andy are reading all of them.
Liesje & Andy met with the oncologist and neurosurgeon yesterday, and go in on Wednesday for Lachie to have a mask fitting for his radiation therapy, which will start in a couple of weeks. He'll have six weeks of radiation as an outpatient, and rescan after a couple of weeks. The aim of radiation is to shrink the tumour down to give Lachie as much time as possible for him to enjoy life, however, the tumour will grow back and usually doesn't respond to a second round of radiation. The silver lining with this treatment is he gets to be at home doing what he enjoys, instead of being stuck in hospital.
In terms of chemo, there is no real evidence of effectiveness for kids with DIPG, so it's always going to be a question of quality of life vs prolonging his life. There is a trial in Aussie that will be available here post radiotherapy which they will explore, plus look at any other trials elsewhere in the world.
At the moment, Lachie isn't aware of what is going on, other than there's something going on that is affecting his vision, so he's still his normal full of life self. We hope to keep it that way as long as possible for obvious reasons.
If you have any questions or ideas that may help, please feel free to contact me directly.
I will continue to update this page as we navigate this nightmare.

Hi Nikki, would the family be interested in 4 tickets to Elton John on Jan 28th in Auckland? I read that Lachie loves music. I have a daughter the same age as Lachie who loves Elton, and we can’t make it. Let me know if I can help. Thanks. Shane
Nikki
Hi Shane, thanks so much for your generous offer! I think we may have failed Lachie in that he isn't sure who Elton John is, so we wouldn't feel right taking them from you, it's also right around the time treatment starts so we're not sure how he'll be feeling then. Once again your offer is very much appreciated!

Dean was sent to a hematologist who performed a bone marrow biopsy, which ultimately led to a diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma. A 24 round week chemotherapy was started. He managed the treatment as expected & then had a stem cell/bone marrow transplant in the July, once his body had recovered from the transplant he went into remission.
On January 10th 2023 3 years to the day since he was first diagnosed, his hematologist phoned, his cancer was back with a vengeance. He started chemotherapy a couple of days after he was diagnosed again. It seemed to be working after the first 4 rounds bringing his numbers down. The next 4 rounds were different, his numbers shot straight back up again. A couple of weeks later it turned to custard. Dean was told to go straight to hospital, 2 hours later he lost full use of his legs. The myeloma had spread to his bones, weakened his spine to the point it collapsed onto his spinal cord & crushed it, rendering him paralysed. The only option was 5 rounds of radiation to blast & kill the myeloma cells on the spine. Dean is now a paraplegic. He has had to start new treatment as the chemotherapy regime he was on has been overpowered by the myeloma and doesn’t work for him anymore. He is absolutely devastated as loss of his income, they are struggling to survive financially. Thank you all so much xx

Update 27/9: Funds raised will go towards supporting the family financially & to help them to make the most of the precious little time they may have left with Dean.

With govt funded drugs being tried & now being ineffective, future treatments will now be self funded. Daratumumab (Darzalex) & Pomalidomide are most likely the most effective drugs, but very expensive. So the money raised will be going towards that.","Update 27/9: Funds raised will go towards supporting the family financially & to help them to make the most of the precious little time they may have left with Dean.--With govt funded drugs being tried & now being ineffective, future treatments will now be self funded.

$$ Goal, the girls have been advised by Trinity's ever watchful & caring Dr, that due to Trinitys current battle with Scurvy and her seriously malnourished state, she needs to delay travel for a short while whilst we seek out an alternative way to get an access line put in and also access fluid & nutrition to try and build Trinity's body back up to a level that will be strong enough to cope with the travel and surgery. This of course will all have to be privately funded, so PLEASE don't give up on our girl, a delay to strengthen and build is NOT saying that we are no longer trying to get to Germany,, in fact it is quite the opposite, the URGENCY has just gone up another level, so come on people, please keep sharing Trinity's story with friends, colleagues, work mates & even total strangers. EVERY $$ counts.

""NEED for SURGERY""
30 May 2024
It has come to our attention that enquiries are being made regarding the recent diagnosis of Scurvy, and whether this will impact Trinitys need for surgery in Germany.
"" SCURVY"" has been a result of the severe malnutrition caused by the inability to absorb or maintain any of her oral nutrition as a result of the abdominal vascular compression syndromes, and therefore further highlights our desperate need to get Trinity to Germany for life saving multiple decompression surgery.
We are pleased to advise that this week the DHB has been giving Trinity daily Multi Vitamin infusions and yesterday the girls were informed that the funding for the vitamin C had been approved, so beginning next week, Trinity will be receiving intermuscular injections of Vitamin C to bring her levels back to an acceptable level.
We are still very much focused on getting Trinity to Germany , with another fundraising event being organised by Anna & Trinity in HB for those Equine followers. Check out Trins page for more info.

"" Rollercoaster ""
24 May 2024
Yes,, Life for Trinity is most definitely likened to that of a roller coaster. Whilst her days are, at best up and down, her Health conditions are mostly down. The latest in her diagnosed conditions is "" SCURVY "" Yeup you read that right,, a medical condition that generally has not reared its ugly head for over a 150 years and our girl has now been diagnosed with it.
What is Scurvy??? As per Google search;
Scurvy
Also called: scorbutus.
A condition caused by a severe lack of vitamin C in the diet.
According to Trinity's latest blood test results ( As per her wonderful G.P's regular care and watchful eye ) her Vitamin C level is ZERO.
No real surprise there considering her inability to hold down any food, and yet when presenting at Hospital as per her Drs instructions and email the Drs appeared surprised 😯, and now we have been informed "" Excited "" 😱😡
Thankfully DHB agreed to put in a line for I.V infusion and then later informed that they needed to apply for approval for funding to get this, as it is not a normal medication kept in store. Anyways not all is lost, as they have offered infusion on Multi Vitamin. Whilst this will not have the level of Vit C that Trins body requires, it is at least something, and for that we are extremely grateful.
In the meantime, the Girls, Grae and I are working hard to get us to the finish line.
So close now.

NEARLY THERE 👏👏
22 May 2024
Yes that is right,, thanks to an incredibly generous donation from a couple in Germany we are now 2 thirds of the way in achieving our $180k target.
Anna and Trinity received a phone call from our friends in Germany this morning informing them of this mind blowing donation and they are still reeling from the knowledge that this Mammoth goal that we set ourselves is now so close to becomming a reality.
We also want to take this opportunity to say THANK YOU once again to you all for what you have done to help us get to where we currently are. We are eternally grateful to everyone of you. THANK YOU ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
The push is now on for the final $60k so this lifesaving surgery can become a reality for our Angel.
🇩🇪 😇

A Synopsis ""Trinity's story"" refer ""A Compressed Angel"" on facebook
2 May 2024
HOW ARE YOU? A question of caring, yet 1 that fills me with dread.
I want to answer, I am well. I want to be honest, I don't want to make the person asking uncomfortable by speaking the truth. Maybe 1 day I will be comfortable speaking about my health issues, but I am not there yet.
My health is not who I am. It is what is happening to me. I struggle with the impacts of having rare health conditions that are not acknowledged by our health System & being told, what I am experiencing is in my head.
I am a foodie, grateful for the fact that most days I still get some hunger signals & desire to eat, however It doesn't matter what or how much I eat, the results are always the same.
My life is like living with never ending Gastroenteritis. I can't stay hydrated or keep down food. I spend my days battling dizziness & trying not to faint.
I long for a day that I can stand without causing my heart to have a total freak out & my vision to completely disappear.
I dream of how life would be without the constant tremors in my hands & body that make simple tasks so difficult. To go for a walk without setting off gut & pelvis pain & having my vision blur.
I know, surgery for the Compressions is not a magic cure, but it CAN give me a chance to some quality of life & not just a slow painful death from malnutrition.
For me, it is a LIFELINE. I hate feeling like a burden & I hurt seeing the stress on Mum, Nanna & Gada as they try to raise awareness & funds for myself & others.
Trinity 💞

""Half Way"" 👌😁
9 April 2024
Yes, unbelievably we have finally managed to get to the halfway mark in our quest to raise the $180K to get our Trinity to Germany before it is too late.
I (Trinity's Nanna /Lynn) have actually managed to complete the cycle / walk from Blenheim to Hawkes Bay in time to also be ready & available for the TV interview on the AM Show on Monday morning 8th April. Regrettably it turned out that they were running approx 12mins or so behind time when it came to my interview and so instead of the 5-6 mins of time that they had said would be allocated we only ended up with approx 2-3minutes tops and as such a lot of information was unable to be expressed, amazingly tho the donations began flowing in and it has left us ALL feeling very humbled, and even slightly believing that MAYBE, just MAYBE we will manage to get to our goal and manage to save our Angels precious life.🙏🤞
As Trinity's Grandparents, we shall be spending a few more days here in Hawkes Bay with our girls before heading Northwards and I shall be on my bike again, hoping to raise further awareness of this dreadful condition and trying against all odds to achieve our target amount to get Trinity & her Mum on their way to Germany.
THANK YOU ALL 💐💕 from the bottom of our 💔 for all the wonderful support that you have shown us thus far, we are optimistically close now so PLEASE share our story and help us to get to the finish line.

Trins health is Spiralling and in the meantime..............
7 March 2024
So it is now March 7th, and 11 more days will see Grae and I leaving our new found homebase in Blenheim so that I may begin the task that I have set myself to cycle / walk to our Trinity in Hawkes Bay. Regrettably Bridget has had to withdraw for personal reasons, so I shall be tackling this on my own (with support from Grae who will be following with our Motorhome, so I have somewhere to lay my weary body at the end of each day.) We look forward to meeting many and sharing our story, with the hope that people will be encouraged to speak up when faced with Health issues and not to be intimidated into accepting the first diagnosis you are given if things just do not add up for you.
I Cycle / walk for TRINITY
I Cycle / walk for EDS & AVC's Awareness
I Cycle / walk for Improved Health Care
I Cycle / walk for YOU.....

I'm Cycling /Walking to Trinity
2 February 2024
I have been inspired and motivated by Taylor Doyles Grandmother ""Bridget"" to participate in her ""Walk to Trinity"" to try and bring much needed Awareness of this debilitating and life threatening condition to the Public eye. Abdominal Vascular Compression Syndrome is still being ignored by our Health System and being referred to as a Fad diagnosis or a very rare condition ( both comments being used as a way to ignore a condition that is being diagnosed more and more frequently, privately funded of course) This has to Stop, we need the people of our Country to demand change and allow these youngsters to be treated fairly, and not ignored and left to die 😭. I shall be joining Bridget in Blenheim to continue the AWARENESS walk to Trinity in Hawkes Bay. Our awareness walk is united, however we will not always be travelling together as we endeavour to maximise our voice by approaching different venues from different directions etc on our travels.
I will be departing Blenheim March 18th Ferry crossing 19th March.

DONATIONS
20 January 2024
Hello all you lovely people out there, I would just like to take this opportunity on behalf of Grae, myself, Anna, and of course our darling Trin of thanking you all for your loving support in our very ambitious task of trying to raise the funds necessary to get Trinity to Germany for the surgery that ultimately can safe her life.
We are blown away with the amount raised so far, however we are still a fair way from achieving the required amount.
We have recently had a couple of questions asked of us which got me to thinking 🤔, the question? "" What will you do with funds donated IF for some reason you don't get to Germany? 🥺
ANSWER: Any funds raised that have not been used for Health care for Trin would be either offered back as a refund to Donor ( less any fees charged) or if Donor wishes, then we could pass on funds to another deserving cause of your choosing.
We don't have a set date for Trin's surgery yet but her health is declining daily. If, for any reason, we don't get to Germany, then we will post another update with further information as well as details for people to contact us should they wish for a refund or transfer - Givealittle will not be involved in any refund process.
We are aware that some people are nervous of donating monies to a cause only to find out later that the funds were not used as they were intended, this most certainly is NOT the intention of our family and what we are trying to achieve.
I hope that this will in some way give piece of mind to those that have concerns.
Thank you all once again for your support thus far.
Lynn 💔💔💔

""FINANCE""
19 December 2023
As Trinity's Grandmother I have been asked a few times now "" WHY $180k?"" Why do we not contribute to the $180k required for Germany? and as I have said all along, we (Trinity's Mum and her Grandparents) have always said we will be as forthcoming with information as we can be and as time allows.
Anna does not own her own home and she and Trinity have committed a great percentage of their finances into medical care over the past few years, and as for Grae and I ? Well we sold up everything we owned just on 9 years ago now and purchased a Motorhome in the hope of travelling this fair Country & enjoying Retirement with surplus funds invested for incidentals, living costs and making memories.
Fast forward to today, , we have now parked up semi permanent, & working in a Holiday Park to help subsidise ongoing medical care and have used the majority of retirement funds set aside to pay for Trins medical care to date, including diagnostics etc. We no longer have a home to Mortgage or refinance, and so this is where we are at.
Fundraising to date incl givealittle is now at just over $50k so we still need to raise a further $130k to save our Angels life.

"" WIPEOUT ""
23 November 2023
. 🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️ ANGEL CHECK IN 🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️
She is unwell in appearance.
wt 45
Pale skin.
Fades out at moments. Eyes drift.
Hands are cooler.
Stumbling while walking or with prolonged standing.
Everything remains delicate and complicated.
💥 She is damn determined, but her body is refusing to allow much now.
😪 Her energy levels allow pretty much for one ""thing"" a day.
📝Today's ""thing"" was a trip to Hastings for an appointment. 17 minutes drive each way and 2 x 10 minute appointments.
😴 That's it, she is totally wiped and the nausea and pain have knocked her for a six again. She is now resting so she can attempt to eat something in a couple of hours.
💖 She has asked us to pass on a big thank you for all who participated in the Auctions and attended the Event at the Filter Room on Friday.
She was stunned to see everyone there, and says sorry to those she didn't catch up with.
🧍‍♀️Standing and walking for any length of time gets very challenging for her and she was desperate to not pass out while there.
✨ ️🎈While she may be struggling with recovery from such a big night, you all created many magical moments for the girls to reminisce over of which we are all extremely grateful 🎈✨️

""ANGEL COMMUNITY""
15 October 2023
https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551410426812&mibextid=ZbWKwL
We have a beautiful community of Angels building on our Fb page that has been set up for our wonderful supporters to be able to keep up to date with our progress. We are running an online Auction from Nov 10-17 and are asking all to give it a follow to keep up to date. Trinity is struggling more with her health and her symptoms are getting worse, as the daily pain and vomiting increases, and now a bit of a battle trying to raise Trins sodium and potassium levels. Plus a need to double check her cortisol on Tues as that is a time sensitive test but her GP is concerned thatvthe last test numbers were possibly a bit low. Other than that the rest of the bloodwork is looking okish for now thankfully as Trins weight is now sitting down at around 45kgs. Our girls have never been the types to just give up so are still pushing hard to still live and enjoy life to the best of the angels abilities. This has included loving time spent connecting with their beloved friends and a little bit of time with the horses which of course lifts their spirits immensely.
To all of you who have donated either through here or to the Auction, words can never express our gratitude. You are what keeps our hope alive for our Angel. We ask that you please give our fb page a follow and share it with your friends and contacts to help us spread the word. Thank you once again ❤️

A Roller Coaster
20 September 2023
This past week has been a roller coaster of emotions for us all, lack of sleep, increased pain & lack of nutrition is really beginning to take its toll on both Trin & her Mum Anna. While many people offer up many suggestions of what we could or should do to increase our chances of getting to Germany including "" resting up "" we say thank you & whilst your comments are acknowledged we would like to point out that we ARE giving this our all, including approaching Media, writing to MOH, approaching M.Ps etc etc , so while we are doing all of this, is it that much to ask of 🫵 to push a button & share our story, our plea?
This IS a battle for Trinity's life and a battle against time. My apologies if I appear abrupt & unappreciative, I'm not,, I am just a VERY worried and concerned Grandmother at a loss for what else I can do to help my babies 🥹🥹
For additional information re Trinity and her condition please check out her Facebook page:
https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551410426812&mibextid=ZbWKwL

Oh P.S,, Trinity STILL waiting for jpeg line replacement from DHB so she can once again get some pain relief and a little nutrition. Now been told it could be Mid to late October !!!!😱😭

Flight cost ???
14 September 2023
For those questioning the cost of flight being in vicinity of $27,000 return ;
Yes this is flying Business Class and reason for this is ;
When you are traveling that far with someone who is very sick, unfortunately there is no other option than to fly business class, especially when they are constantly vomiting, tachcardic and in severe pain. There is also a much higher risk of flying with being that unwell, so they need to be as comfortable as possible, it's such a shame that it costs so much, but this is our reality of what we need to pay if we are to save our loved ones lives. 🥹💔❤️‍🩹

COSTINGS:
12 September 2023
To give a little clarity on where and how the $180k needed, I requested a breakdown of costs from a family that has just returned from Germany.
Due to restriction of number of words allotted here I have had to combine a lot, so this is an estimate only:
FLIGHTS $27k
TRANSPORT GERMANY / LEPZIG, DUSSELDORF $9K
SCANS $16K
SURGERY $105K
PHYSIO, MEDS, POST OP $5K
HOTEL/ HOSP ACCOMODATION $5K.
On top of this, due to early departure (for personal reasons) there is still approx $15 / $20k for another month of accomodation, post care & physio.
I hope this goes some way to clarifying costs for those interested.

GREEN LIGHT, It's a Go.....
12 September 2023
RIGHT Folks,
Confirmation has been received. Germany is now a GO
Dear Mrs.McGrath,
The findings from the scans are: severe compression of the left renal vein , which is called nutcracker syndrome; compression of
the third part of the duodenum, called WILKIE Syndrome, Compression of the left common iliac vein; called MAY-THURNER Syndrome, Compression of the celiac artery and the solar plexus<, called MALS. The underlying basic disorder is, hypermobility , most probable due to hypermobile EDS. All compressions are suitable for decompression surgery and in regard to the symptoms and dysfunctions Your daughter complains about , surgery is recommended. Trinity should undergo functional ultrasound -Duplex examination with Prof. Scholbach at Leipzig, to explore the functional consequences and to find out, if Trinity has POTS from floating kidneys.
Kind regards Wilhelm Sandmann, Dr. med. Prof. of surgery and vascular surgery
Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Prof. Dr. med. Dr. h.c. Wilhelm Sandmann
Chefarzt für Gefäßchirurgie Experte für Kompressionssyndrome

MEDIA
29 August 2023
Hi folks,
Not a lot to report at present. Trinity is still losing weight and had a rather severe blowout with blood pressure going awol on Friday night ( giving her Mum Anna a few more grey hairs) and leaving her even more fatigued, however she is an amazingly resilient girl & refuses to give up for which we are very grateful. The girls are still waiting on a replacement pegj line to be supplied so at least Trin will then be able to get at least a minimal amount of nutrition and pain relief instead of having to take orally, which we all know how that works for her. By the girls calculations it will be possibly another 10 days at least before Hawkes Bay DHB has a replacement and then they will have to wait for a day to be allocated for the surgery.
In the meantime the girls have been busy trying to gather all of Trins health records held by the respective DHB's, no mean fete there, believe me 🤨 especially when Te Whatu Ora insists that you supply proof of idenditity and a Birth certificate does not qualify... Trin does not have a passport, is not permitted a driver license, & does not have a school card as did most of her schooling in Hospital or at home, not easy.
Last but not least, Thanks for the help of a very dear friend, Trinity's story has been put to the Media to see if we can get their support in getting this out to the public arena, fingers crossed, so watch this space for further info, will let you know as we know, thank you. 💝🩷🧡

Professor Sandmann / Germany
17 August 2023
Last night Anna finally managed to get all of Trins tests currently held on file here sent to Professor Sandmann (Germany's Vascular Surgeon) for his perusal and comments and more importantly whether or not he could see signs of vascular compressions. He has had a quick look at some of the scans & reports:
""For the moment being, I could see that Trinity suffers from scoliosis, May-Thurner syndrome, medium arcuate ligamentum syndrome and left renal vein compression.
This now confirms what Fraser Burling indicated to us of Vascular Compression.
Prof Sandmann has yet to finish a full review of the scans supplied, but for now we know for certain that this is the minimum that is showing.
Next step is FULL review by the Proffessor and then Video Consult.
Funding is now positive, PLEASE HELP by sharing this page.

A ""NEW"" Challenge
4 August 2023
Yet another blow was dealt Trinity this week, her PEG-J tube decided to break. This is the line that goes directly into her stomach for nutritional & pain relief, without it she must resort to taking everything orally which causes immediate nausea, pain & vomitting, not to mention further weight loss and the inevitable malnutrition. According to the ""powers at be"" the consensus still remains at ORAL IS BEST 😱. Meeting held today to review this, so once again we wait to see whether this line will be replaced OR removed.
In the meantime Trin has lost another half kilo in weight this week while we wait.
We are now preparing to send Trins scans etc to Germany to at least get Prof Sandmans opinion.
We have been told that Trin is 24th in line for tests in N.Z so at allocation of 3 per month that is an 8 month wait before tests would be done here ( and yes that IS even by going privately).

EMOTIONAL DAY
1 August 2023
UPDATE.
We met with a surgical GP yesterday who has gone over her CT scan that was done in February, (plus others which he described as impressive) and he pointed out an area in her small intestines that shows an area of ballooning followed by an area of collapse which he suspects is from abdominal adhesions. He also has found that her pelvic arteries are enlarged which he says could be a strong indicator of abdominal vascular compressions. He was amazing in explaining what her previous surgeries have actually entailed. For years I have been parroting the words of what has been done without understanding the meaning behind them.
It was incredible watching him as he was examining her, pressing on different parts of her abdomen and everytime she reacted in pain he was like ""yip that makes sense"" so many emotions in that appointment as finally we are seeing a glimmer of light out of the ""No man's land of the DHBs"" ""There IS NOTHING WRONG, TESTS SHOW NOTHING, SHE JUST NEEDS TO EAT"" and actually having a direction to head in that will hopefully save her life.
Next step is for Dynamic Visceral Duplex scanning and another CT scan. Total cost for just these scans is a scary $5000.00 plus. If compression syndrome is confirmed then we will need to get her to Germany for surgery. This is our only chance at getting her the help she so desperately needs.

June asks
Hi Lynn,
I note above that Professor Sandman found May-Thurner syndrome , the connective tissue syndrome. And also one renal vein compression. Is this perhaps good news as you mentioned more, I believe? Just hoping things go easier for her during surgery.
Lynn
Hi June, Please don't take this as gospel as there is just so much going on for our Trinity at present and symptoms etc seem to be changing daily. At this point in time Professor Sandmann has confirmed 4 (maybe 5) compressions from the Scans that Anna sent from here. Anna was also informed of the high possibility of more being detected once she and Trinity get to Germany and have the imaging done over there as per Prof Sandmanns requirements.

Michael asks
What have the German doctor said about surgery in Germany? like when will it happen etc
Lynn
Hello Michael, thank you for your interest.
Proffessor Sandmann has done a preliminary consult and diagnosis from scans and tests that we had sent to him. From these tests alone he has diagnosed Trinity with scoliosis, May-Thurner syndrome, medium arcuate ligamentum syndrome and left renal vein compression.
A Surgery date has NOT been set yet due to the fact that we need first off to have the funds necessary to get to Germany and for cost of surgery. If we can not raise the funds necessary then it will not be an option for us 😢.

Michael asks
Kia Ora,
What airline are you flying with?
Have you asked them for help? Sometimes they will give free upgrades or flights when approached. I believe some airlines allow people to transfer air miles, check with the airline. If they do then you can ask people to donate air miles. Also post-covid a lot of people have credit with airlines that may be transferable.
Kia kaha.
Kind regards,
Michael
Lynn
Hello Michael,
Thank you for your enquiry and suggestions. With regard to Airline, we have not given that any thought at present as we are still a long way off $ target to be able to confirm surgery travel. Much as we would love to believe that we could be looking at surgery within in the next month or so the reality is we just do not know, and we do not really want to put ourselves under any more pressure than what we are currently dealing with. Once we get a little closer to attaining our goal we will relook at your suggestions. Thank you."

As you may or may not know, Dan Fong, Leece's husband, has recently been diagnosed with an extremely rare and aggressive cancer (just 10 cases in the world).
The past month has already been a tumultuous road for Dan, Leece and their four boys, as the doctors have worked tirelessly to figure out Dan's diagnosis.
With a rare and complex diagnosis comes a very aggressive treatment plan. One element of which is a stem cell transplant, requiring at least a four month stay in Brisbane, away from his home, his children and loved ones.
Many of you from this amazing community have approached us wanting to help. Here is one way in which you can help - of course ONLY if feasible for you at this time. Please understand we feel your support even if you're not in a position to donate.
To add, Leece has been on the fence about us doing this - about asking for help - but I have insisted she does, especially as I have had so many of you asking about ways in which you can help the family.
Thank you SO much for your love, offers to help and support so far. It has been overwhelming.
PS - please go and donate bone marrow if you can, and especially if you're Māori Chinese or Pacific Islander.

Connors's bone marrow transplant seemed to be a success and Connor had returned to school and had been enjoying spending time with his friends and learning.
At the end of April 2024 after an ultrasound, Connor's care team were concerned with what they were seeing and tragically bone marrow tests have now confirmed that Connor has now relapsed for a second time.

Apologies for the lack of updates on Connor. We have not had any news as to an updated time frame that Connor will be heading to Aus. Connors mum has been in regular contact with the Hospital but unfortunately, even although his treatment has been marked urgent, they still dont have a date. This is understandably incredibly stressful for Connor's mum and dad as Connor needs to have his deasease below a required level to proceed with treatment. The longer time goes on whilst waiting for a treatment date, the riskier it becomes with Connor' current health level continuing.

Wow! Thank you all so very much for your out pouring of generosity for Connors treatment. We are utterly speechless and forever grateful for the kindness you have shown wee Connor.
Connor has been discharge from hospital at the moment and has spent the weekend at home with his family. He has been busy making a small veggie garden with his brother and mum and dad to cheer him up.
Thank you again, your generosity is so beautiful and incredibly overwhelming

Three fantastic steps in the right direction
8 June 2024
After a very tense wait on Wednesday evening, a team of specialists have confirmed that Connor is now approved for CAR T therapy pending funding from high health MOH.
Connors recent bone marrow aspirate showed incredibly low levels of the disease meaning his recent round of chemotherapy has been effective.
Connors CAR T has been marked as urgent and he will be heading to Melbourne shortly to undergo his approved treatment.
Thank you all again for those that have shared or donated. If everyone can continue sharing we get Connor even closer to his CAR T therapy goal.

CAR-T is probably Connor’s best option, just being accepted is incredible. In some cases the manufacturer will donate their contribution on compassionate grounds.

1966 beads at count today with more awaiting us, I remember asking ccf at one stage how many beads at most had they given and at the time she said 1500. Every bead represents anything relating to treatment Eg white is chemo, blue clinic visits, black every time blood was taken or line accessed etc.

Connor has begun his next lot of chemo
25 May 2024
Connor has now been admitted at rhe beginning of this week into Christchurch Children's ward to begin more chemo therapy and put in new central lines.
Connor is having intensive spinal chemo and iv chemo mix to try and keep him eligible for his CAR T therapy. Connor remains in high spirits but obviously is begining to feel the effects of the chemo on his body again.
Thank you all to the generous donors, please give the page a share too so we can get as much reach as possible for Connor and his family's sake.
Much love to you Connor and family 🖤

At the young age of 36, with an 17 month old daughter and a 3 month old son, Adele has recently had the shock of her life being diagnosed with the horrible disease we all hate so much - stage 4 cancer (bowel and lymph nodes - braf mutation).
As stubborn and as strong as Adele is (and always has been🙈), her and her beautiful family need some help to relieve the financial pressure they now face as they embark on their healing journey.
With multiple appointments, non funded treatment option discussions, loss of two incomes while Shane, Adele's loving husband, steps up to help at home, anything we can raise will make a huge difference now and in the future.
Unfortunately, only a few months before being diagnosed, Adele cancelled their life insurance policy that they had held for 10 years to try and help relieve financial stress and pay off some debt.
Adele has always been so supportive and giving to others, so now is our time to give back to her❤️

26 May 2024
Posted by: Adele Baker
I have had 3 chemo treatments- they are fortnightly. My 6w CT scan was on Tuesday 21st May. Lymph nodes are smaller. Tailbone tumour is larger.
The lower back/hip pain has been keeping me from living my life. I am in constant pain. It’s been 3m of this now and I’m feeling defeated.
Thursday 23rd May I received a phone call from a radiologist Doctor to go into Auckland Hospital urgently.
They advised that the tumour in my tail bone has grown considerably, it is on my nerves and there is a high chance that it will kill nerves. If that happens it will leave me unable to feel from my waist down.
Treatment plan is 5 days of radiation to hopefully shrink it and hopefully avoid nerve damage.
I had my first radiation treatment the following day. Last day is Wednesday 29th May.
Next week chemo will be pushed out to Thursday to Saturday. Between radiation and chemo I have treatments 8 of 9 days. It is going to take its toll on me and my whanau this week but it will hopefully mean I will no longer be in constant pain and I can live normally.
No words for all the aroha we have received

Our lives - From Adele
18 April 2024
Posted by: Adele Baker
In the time it took for a lymph nodes to grow we tried to live our normal lives as having a now 20m (Harper) and 6m (Taylor) is full on. Shane is unable to work as I cannot care for our babies on my own. I have days that I couldn’t lift with my left arm, can’t walk due to back aches, too tired to get up.
We celebrated my 37th bday by spending the morning at the park, afternoon jumping off the harbour bridge with Shane (thanks mum and dad for the gift) Dinner with my parents,good friend Dale,Shane,Harper and Taylor. Best day ever.
Now Harper can say animal names and sounds it was time for our first visit to the zoo. Something I’ve been looking forward to since she was born. Memories I will cherish.
As hard as it is, I’ve had no choice but to come to terms with the fact that it would be a miracle to celebrate my 40th. All I want to do is make my husband and babies lives as easy as possible after I’ve gone. It hurts me more thinking about how much grief and pain they will suffer. I won’t be here to help them through the most difficult times of their lives.
One day my babies will forget about me. They won’t have any memories only videos, stories, photos, letters etc. I will do everything in my power to be here as long as possible in the hopes that they will have their own memory of their biological mum.

Chemo update
18 April 2024
Posted by: Adele Baker
Your generosity has helped us so much through this trying time and is much appreciated. We have the utmost respect for you and cannot thank you enough for your kindness.
I made the decision to wait for the size of the tumours in my lymph nodes to grow to meet the criteria for a trial called Breakwater Trial - for people with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer.
This trial was my best chance to gain a few extra months with my family. As it is a trial, not everyone gets picked for the trial drugs.
I found out Monday that I was not picked for the trial drug. I am receiving the standard treatment drugs.
Tuesday morning was the start of my first chemotherapy session. It takes 6hrs to administer. I wear home a bag and takes 46hrs to empty via IV line into my Portacath.
Day 2 - I have been sick a few times but mostly slept the day away.
Day 3- Today is ok. The bag gets removed at 2pm. Looking forward to not having a bum bag attached to me.

To start chemo or to spend time with her babies
8 March 2024
Hi Team.
A bit of an update from Adele today...
She had another scan this week and unfortunately her lymph nodes have grown, but not to the size of the trial criteria yet. Currently biggest one under her arm is 1.5cm x 1.3cm. Needs to be 1.5x1.5cm.
The rest have all grown too.
Cancer has spread to new area as well - to the
bottom of her tail bone. Which is where she has been sore for the last few weeks and went to the chiropractor for last week.
Adele has asked a lot of questions. Got a lot of answers but of course they can’t give her anything but probabilities as cancer is not the same for everyone and not everyone responds to treatments the same.
Adele has not decided what her next step is yet. Whether she starts chemo or waits for another 4 weeks to spend more time with her two babies xx

I believe we both should have many years of life to make great memories. Kobie is my rock and I would do anything to make him happy. Four and a half years ago I was diagnosed with Squamous cell Carcinoma stage 4. This is a skin cancer that has got into my lungs. I have been receiving chemo on and off for the last 4 years. But it won't cure me. My only hope of a cure is to have a drug called Keytruda which cost approximately $10,000 dollars a time and I require it 10 times which means I need a total of $100,000. Unfortunately, it is not funded for my type of cancer. I have written to Head of the DHB, the Health Minister and the Prime Minister to try to get it funded but all refused. So I now have to do something I really did not want to and ask people to help me and my family.
Update 2023: Unfortunately we have now had another family tragedy in January 2023 with Kobie losing his beloved Poppa in a car accident, and his nana being critically injured, which means he really should not lose his Dad as well. A few weeks after the accident, I was diagnosed with two brain tumours, which means the chemo is no longer working as the cancer has now spread to my brain. It is also in my trachea, and perilously close to my spinal cord in my neck, with nerves wrapping around my spine . If it spreads into my spinal cord I will be paralysed.
I am 60 years old and live with my wonderful wife Debbie and my absolute gem of a little man Kobie. Due to the illness, and ongoing treatment, I am unable to work. I do use my free time to help out where ever I can like my Katikati Bowling club, reading to children at Katikati Primary School, helping out POTS group and Katikati Soccer Club. When I am cured I look forward to be able to go back to work.

17 June 2024
This is the hardest update we have ever had to post and one we had kept at bay for the last almost 6 years.
The Keytruda treatment Roy has been having is no longer working, and treatment has ceased. There are no further treatment options available, and he is now purely on palliative care. While initially the treatment had worked extremely well on most of his tumours, the brain tumours and the tumour in his spine have just not responded and have increased in size (one has doubled in size since February).
So, what now? Now we make Roy's life as comfortable as possible and make as many memories as we can in the short time he has left (weeks to months according to the doctors). Any funds raised from here on, and the funds left over from treatment will go towards doing basic fun things with our son, and towards a simple funeral for Roy when the time comes.
We would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who has donated, commented, sent well wishes, and shared our story. Every dollar raised has given Roy almost another year (and counting) of quality life with his son and wife, family and friends, which is absolutely priceless. Thank you, thank you thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Roy, Debbie and Kobie xxx

It's Working!
11 October 2023
A huge thank you to everyone who has donated money, goods, time and help with fundraisers. We are extremely grateful for every cent and humbled by the amount of support we have received. To date we have raised a whopping total of $87000, through Givealittle and fundraisers. In June I started Keytruda even though we didn't have all the funds needed, I had run out of options and my cancer had spread to my brain. The doctor said if I didn't start now, it would be too late. Too date I have had 6 treatments, and one scan. The scan has shown that some of my tumours have shrunk and others remain stable which is the news we have been hoping for. So, to continue with this treatment we now only need $13000 more. If you can help by donating or sharing, it would mean the world to us. We are so close now, we never imagined we could get this far but here we are!

Lorraine asks
This is not so much a question as a suggestion. My heart breaks for you and your family.
My husband is receiving Keytruda for an unfunded condition. We had sold our house in Auckland and bought a little transportable and invested the larger part of the capital in regular dividend producing NZ companies because I had a premonition of life events not aligned with our wishes.
We cashed in a sizeable amount to fund Keytruda and are happy together in our little house.
This is the second time things have forced a financial rethink. The first being 2000 when we sold our business and home and moved into a large caravan.
My experience is you have nothing if you haven’t got your health and the love of your family. You will get well Roy and you can live a diffent life, not necessarily lesser.
Love to you and your family,
Lorraine.
We have donated albeit a lesser amount than we would have wished.
Roy
It is something I have thought long and hard about and may still do in the furture. I am very much a planner and have set goals to hopefully raise money to have first 10 month of treatment. I guess it is a fine balancing act which when I start treatment will give me a better guide on which way to continue. I thank you for your kind words and thoughts because as you are well aware it is not easy to stay focus and realizeleaving you family finaical stable or having you can sometimes get a little bit mixed up as you are right being here for as long as possibleb is the most important thing."

On this day last year I was getting a serious dose of chemo. A one hit wonder, 30 minutes long. The weeks in an isolation suite and months of pain following are the hardest of my life.
Today, I am back at work, full time, 3 months to the day post chemo I got back into uniform, two hours after a fitness test slog. I couldn’t have done it without the support of my family and all you generous donors.
Thank you again. We hope the remission will last a good while, what we do know is a relapse is a reality. What is unused of the funds donated will be used to fund drugs that are again not funded and I can tell you the price tag is eye watering!! We have kept every dollar donated aside to fund those drugs.
Thank you again, love your family and friends because you never know what is around the corner.

Hi all, hope you’re doing amazing. What a summer it’s been so far huh!
I spoke to my Haemotologist earlier this month and she’s said I can use the word remission! It’s taken a few weeks to get my head around and be confident using it. We know it won’t stay that way but as Amber said, we take the wins where we can.
In other news out little Harry is just over 5 months old and a little character, pic for cuteness factor.
Thank you all again for your amazing generosity. Our boys still have their dad around thanks to everyone helping us.
Let’s hope Pharmac introduce some more funding for the drugs I will need in the future.

Hi wonderful supporters. It has been a while since I've given an update on where things are at, a little (okay maybe a lot) of change has gone on in the last few months.
On the 3rd of July I got the sign off from my Haematologist to attempt my fitness test for work. Of course getting to that point was not east. When I got our of hospital in April after my Stem Cell Transplant, I could only run few hundred metres and do 5 press-ups, that was a big problem in itself. Over the coming weeks from there I pushed and pushed and eventually got to around a 4km two or three times a week and I walked the big hill in Queenstown; bottom of the Gondola to the top and down again. This I think was enough to convince my Haem that I was in good enough shape to do the test and return to work. Two days after being signed off I went and did the test and had a good 20 seconds to spare. The next day I jumped back in uniform. Finally some normality!!
Some of you may have seen an article in the paper last week about drug funding and Pharma. These drugs are so so important to me and at a consumer cost of around $220k a year it is important that we lobby for these drugs as much as we can. Thank you to Stuff for helping me get my voice heard. https://www.waikatotimes.co.nz/a/nz-news/350049524/father-two-whos-spent-his-life-serving-public-told-consider-australia-funded
In other news, Harry our latest addition has arrived in the world - photo attached :)

What if it doesn't work!?
28 May 2023
Posted by: Will Hamilton
That is the reality we are facing now, we have had a good week to digest it.
A week ago we learn't that the chemo blast I went for did not work, seemingly did not even touch the sides. How you say? Well I am just one of the 34% of people that it doesn't work for.
For me, I am struggling to see how, I was that sick and hit rock bottom that hard health wise that I am wondering how this ridiculously high dose of chemo didn't work. I can't sit there and wonder though, that doesn't change things.
From here we are back to what we know works for me, Lenalidomide, Velcade and a huge dose of steroids once a week. hopefully that will get it to a point where the Lenalidomide can maintain things....we hope.
I am back to running, I managed to get to 2 kms pushing a pram with Jack yesterday, and still not quite normal blood counts. My specialist was not exactly over the moon that I was back running; but hey, if you don't push yourself how are you meant to improve. Plus I have a fitness test I need to pass soon ha!
I will keep you all updated as we go. What else changes things is all of your generous donations that will allow us to access other treatments not funded or available here in NZ.
Again thank you all for your generosity. You are all amazing

Hi Will
Thank you for your update. I have been wondering how you are. Thinking of you and your family, best wishes for everything. It must be so incredibly hard on you all, take special care of yourself and trust that whoever is up there or out there (the universe, the Lord, angels, passed relatives and friends) are right there by your side looking after you. You've got this 👍
Toxic times - but for the best
21 April 2023
Posted by: Will Hamilton
Earlier this month I went for a long stay in hospital to receive high dose chemotherapy and stem cell return. To be honest, this is probably the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. There were times where I thought I wasn't ever going to get out of bed. I was in a positive pressure room that had it's own filtered environment, filtering out any germs to protect me since the chemo absolutely obliterates your immune system to zero.
The day following the high dose treatment, I received 1/3 of my previously harvested stem cell back, this is otherwise known as day zero. My blood counts as expected continued to drop and drop until essentially my bone marrow was no longer functioning anymore. When you are in this position this is a really really scary thought. When you think about it your bone marrow is responsible for making blood, before it makes blood cells it makes baby cells which turn into many different kinds of cells like white blood cells that make up your immune system. Without a functioning bone marrow you cannot exist.
Bloods were taken every morning at around 4am along with any medication needed. By around day +9 my bone marrow showed signs of life once again and it seemed those tiny little stem cells found their way there and started doing their thing. Being honest, I cried, it was a surreal moment and I got straight on the phone to Amber to give her the news. As my counts increased daily, I felt much more alive and human. For 5 days there at one point I did not get out of bed except to visit the toilet or have what little to eat I could tolerate.
Again the staff in M5 were wonderful, I have my favourites of course but I made a point of telling them they are amazing and thanked them for what they do.
From here, I will have to wait a little while to to see what my bloods look like in terms of tumour markers and an eventual horrid further bone marrow sample to see if any myeloma remains in my bone marrow. I really hope this is not the case!
Thank you all again for your support, I will post more as I find out.
For now, I am finally home and there is no feeling quite like being with my family

Beach Hop and Milkshakes
28 March 2023
Posted by: Will Hamilton
For the last week, we have been making the most of our time together as a family, parking up our 1997 van, jumping in the back and watching Beach Hop cars cruise our little town. The first time in many years I have not worked the event, it was nice to sit back and see it from another perspective.
Staying away from people is not normally what I am about. However with high dose chemo and a lengthy hospital stay coming up it is the only sensible option to stay healthy and give myself the best chance. In a short while I will be going for a month stay in hospital. I am told I will be very sick, on top of lowering daily blood counts and the constant hope that my stem cells graft back to heathy, cancer free bone marrow.
For the next update, Jack and I will have got our hands on a 1976 kitchen stand mixer, Hot Cross Buns are first on the test list.
Keep safe and take care

Harvest time
10 March 2023
Posted by: Will Hamilton
But not the harvesting we are used to.
Earlier this week I went for a pre-planned admission to Hospital to collect my stem cells, also known as Stem Cell Harvesting.
Late last week I began injecting myself twice a day with a growth factor that stimulates my bone marrow to produce, in mass, immature 'baby' cells or stem cells. The downside of this was it makes bone marrow work overtime and creates a fair bit of bone pain around the lower back and long bones. Managed this pretty well with paracetamol.
I was connected to the machine in the picture on the left with one needle in each arm. The machine takes blood from one arm, processes it and targets a specific part of my blood where the stem cells are, filters that out then returns the remainder of my blood through a needle in my other arm. A fairly painless procedure however the downside was I had to sit still for around 6 hours at a time, like actually sit still like I am in the picture. No bending elbows, no standing etc. Fortunately I did not have to go to the toilet.
With me the entire time operating the machine and making fine adjustments were two NZ Blood nurses, Si Woo and Shem. They certainly made the procedure entertaining with their humour, pushing buttons on my laptop when a Netflix episode ended and even scratching my my back when I got an itch.
The target was for 7.5 million stem cells, at the end I think we got around 8 million which is great because the thought of being hooked up to the machine for another day was enough to make me lose sleep!
Once these cells are tested and deemed viable (hopefully) they will remain frozen and some will be returned to me after being wiped out by a high dose of chemo, scary sh*t I tell ya! I will then hopefully have enough cells left over for a further two transplants, depending on how things work out in he future. It is hard to forget that Myeloma is not curable so those cells going forward will give me precious time with my family while we continue to look at other options for treatment, hopefully something a bit more permanent. The reality of even thinking about a more permanent option would not be possible without the generous donations I have received from you all.
Again a big thank you to the NZ Blood nurses and all of the staff of Ward M5 at Waikato Hospital, they're great people and do amazing things with the amount of pressure they are under on top of resource constraints
Happy Friday everyone, have a great weekend :)

Hi everyone, hope you are all doing well after the carnage from the cyclone! Such a significant event with so many people displaced and affected more than most. There is always someone else worse off and I think our friends down the line in Gisborne and Hawkes Bay deserve some support, we got off pretty lightly up here!
Again we are completely blown away and humbled by the support of everyone near and far. Last night a local couple Allen and Maxine hosted a fundraiser event named “Good Will”. Fundraising for the continuation of my treatment. I was speechless most of the night, around 90 people all willing to donate to our cause without us asking or expecting. This community and the people in it are absolutely amazing.
Thank you Whangamata community and everyone that donated, donated goods and services to be auctioned and showed their support.
Equally as much thank you to everyone on this page who have contributed big or small, it all makes a huge difference!
Take care everyone and have a great weekend
Will, Amber and Jack

Three's a crowd
7 February 2023
Posted by: Will Hamilton
But four is more so! We let the cat out of the bag today...We are pregnant!!
Now before people start saying 'you crazy idiots, what are you thinking???!!' There is an order to this seemingly courageous and ambitious sequence of events, I promise you.
On the 21st of November 2022 I went for my full WOF at the Doctor. I went over the road and had my bloods taken like the good boy I am. I got home that day and Amber was fluffing around with Jack trying to give him something to give to me. Jack wasn't having a bar of it and Amber ended up giving it to me; a positive pregnancy test!! We were over the moon and so happy. Now remember at this point I had absolutely no idea what I was in for!
The next morning 22nd November, I received a message through my health app from my Doctor indicating I had abnormal blood results and that I need to pick up a form for more blood tests. Interpreting the blood results and reading a comment from a lab Haematologist saying 'Myeloma needs to be excluded' made my heart sink.
As you can see we went from the biggest high to the biggest low in a matter of hours.
When our world seems like it is crumbling, we look at the good things that are happening all around us, be it the support of friends and family, the generous donors who are potentially saving my life and giving my family more time with me, our amazing friends who have done things for us/given things to us, just like the photographer Jacob who took the photo attached, Andrew my dear friend who helped me change the cambelt and water pump on my beloved 1997 van last week, Nikki one of Ambers friends who is a serial baker dropping off baking and cooking non-stop, friends who have donated outside of this page (names withheld of course ;) ), friends who won't let me pay for a beer at their bar and others who I can't think of right now.
Three's a crowd but four is awesome...technically 5 when we count Irie the dog
Take care everyone :)

No I’m not meaning the weather. On Tuesday morning I woke up with a heart rate of 145 and a temperature, this is when I knew I was in for it. I had picked up an infection from somewhere which probably wouldn’t bother most people, but because of my lowered immune system it kicked my ass! Ambulance and all I was on my way to hospital. We met with an advanced paramedic on the way who gave me Antibiotics. I have nothing but great thanks for the Ambo crew (Barry and Claire, Lisa and one other I can’t remember) who took care of me, Thames hospital staff, particularly my nurses on the ward Sharan and Jennifer who made a bed ridden stay comfortable and fun, support staff Jay Jay (just like she said, she makes one hell of a hot chocolate).
What made this day even more difficult was the fact Jack was to have his Ear Grommet and Adenoid surgery in Hamilton that day. A last minute decision for Amber and Jack to get to Hamilton and go ahead with it was made before I was whisked away. A big thank you to Amber’s mum who joined them taking time off work to help also staying the night over there, driving them both home the next day. Amber is nothing less than a super-mum dealing with all that stress, probably better described as a cluster ….
Now I’m home and continue to improve. We have received countless messages of support, flowers, baking and offers to make things easier. Thank you everyone 😊
Jack is doing just fine, as I write this he is smashing a muffin baked by our friend both into his mouth and the carpet 🤦🏼‍♂️
Take care and stay healthy

Wet weekend activities
29 January 2023
Posted by: Will Hamilton
First things first! Thank you all both new and existing donors for your amazing support. We really don’t know what to say other than thank you again so very much!
Everyone who knows me knows I love getting amongst the action. So this week/end with major road failures,
Floods, infrastructure challenges and lots and lots of rain it’s been rather frustrating that I cannot get in the blue suit and go out there to do my thing, helping people! This is because my doctor has said I can’t due to infection risk and weak bones. Nothing against my Doctor, she is amazing…even if she refused to sign me off to complete my fitness test…understandable when she reads we have to push and stop a 450kg trailer as part of it 🤷🏼‍♂️
Instead this weekend we put together a bed flat-pack. Yes we had screws left over and no I can’t blame Jack! It was great fun with Jack being Captain of the battery drill. Just a slight logistical challenge of no mattress yet, a collapsed major state highway means couriers can’t get here as efficiently. Either way I think Jack approves of his future new bed.
In other news I now had a timeline for my Stem Cell
Harvest. A little scary knowing that’s the first step before high dose chemo…. More on that when the time comes.
Again thank you all for everything, it means the absolute world to our family, knowing we now have options further afield because of the generosity of you amazing people.
Take care Will, Amber, Jack and Irie x

Photo Bombs, appreciation and weekends
21 January 2023
Posted by: Will Hamilton
As the days go by and the number of generous donors like yourselves donate to us increases, the more we are taken back and yep that word again, humbled. There simply is no other word to describe it!
It has been an extremely busy week with work here in Whangamata with not a lot of sleep. IYKYK!
This weekend we have made the most so far. Bike rides, coffee, afternoon naps while Jack has his day nap and just now we have got back from our favourite waterhole not far from us. Memories and activities don’t have to cost anything at all. We are focused on making memories and doing the things we love. Leave the worry of changing my prognosis to the doctors; because let’s be fair, only the doctors and science can change that stuff.
For now, here’s a photo of me and Jack. Was meant to be just Jack… Sorry Amber 😜
Take care all and a very big thank you to all who have generously donated to help us x

Massive Thank You
15 January 2023
Thanks so much to every one of you for kindly donating and for sharing those beautiful messages of support for Will and his family.
When I set the goal to 20K I thought that was a very ambitious goal and I hadn’t anticipated the level of love, caring and generosity that would be shown by so many wonderful people.
I’m increasing the goal at this time because there may be other treatment options for Will overseas. These treatments cost significantly more than those he is currently undergoing (some in the hundreds of thousands).
This new goal is a very ambitious one and I totally understand that not everyone will be in a position to donate.
Will and Amber are already completely blown away by the kindness and generosity that has been shown by you wonderful people.
Sending love to all of you and again a huge thank you ❤️🙏

Thursdays
12 January 2023
Posted by: Will Hamilton
Thursdays are the worst day of the week for me. It is the day that I have to take a very large dose of steroids and inject myself with a Chemotherapy agent (pictured). How the steroids make me feel is very hard to explain. I lose all ability to focus on a task, can't hold a conversation because my mind wanders, my tolerance is significantly reduced and worst of all I cannot sleep. To counter this I have to take half a sleeping pill on a Thursday night before bed. Thankfully though I know these drugs are doing me good.
I got some blood results back yesterday and they are looking really good. The drug I take that this page will help fund is making a huge difference to my markers - although my specialist has not commented yet, I know by the protein levels indicated, that things are looking very very positive.
Again a huge thank you to every donor. It is because of each one of you that I am able to source this medication and get these wins.
Take care

With more than 300 generous Donors and a significant amount of money donated, Amber and I are feeling very humbled and overwhelmed. From the bottom of our hearts we thank each and every one of you. The messages of support flow thick and fast to our inbox. We are looking forward to some summer like weather again so we can go and enjoy some family time at our favourite waterhole once again. The photo is of us on a hot sunny afternoon recently there. For now with this impending storm, it’s time to snuggle up on the couch and remember to be thankful for what you do have. Again thank you for your generousity and thoughts.

Hello everyone, it is safe to say I am truly humbled and overwhelmed by the support that everyone has shown. Neither Amber nor I would create a page our-self because we do not like people fussing over us, so a massive thank you to our dear friend Anna who created this page for us.
The amount raised in less than 24 hours is astonishing! I thank you all dearly for your donations. Like I say to people who I explain my condition to....You go and get injured and cannot work, you will get your income protected and paid by ACC. However go and get cancer, an ultimately fatal one as in my case, you get nothing of the sort. All of your donations are truly truly appreciated and will be well used directly toward my treatment.
The photo below is of me in Thames Chemo unit 05/01/22 - this was me getting a Pentamadine infusion. Pentamadine is a drug which will protect me from pneumonia. Multiple Myeloma patients are not good at regulating the fungus that exists in all of us that leads to Pneumonia. This infusion was 3 hours long with 1 hour prep time before it began. In addition to that the 50 mins travel time each way to the outpatient clinic. The staff at Thames are amazing
My next infusion will be later in Jan with a drug called Biphosphinate - This is to increase the strength of my bones. Because of the amount of steroids I am on this can weaken bones, in addition to that Myeloma being a cancer inside the bone (marrow) this also weakens bones.
I will endevour to keep you all updated on my journey. The grim reality is that Multiple Myeloma is not a curable cancer and my life will be shortened significantly. For now we will take the years and months we can get and make the most of them.
Thank you all current and future donors once again. Again a huge thank you to our friend Anna for getting this off the ground.
Take care everyone

“Kia Ora. This news is shocking for me and everyone I love. I want you all to know that I’m keeping positive and a good way to help is by sending your positive energy and love. I’ve decided to document my healing journey via Instagram (@andyheartthrob), so everyone can be on it with me, so I’m not alone. I have many reasons to live for especially my baby daughter. Ruuru. The journey will be demanding with serious challenges for everyone, but we will succeed together. You might suggest a book, healthy recipe, therapy, a verse or story, everything will help.

We received Andy's liver biopsy results last week, she does not qualify for Cetuximab (Erbitux) but does qualify for Bevacizumab (Avastin). On advice from her nutritionist, she has decided to pursue prescribed medications that are researched to work on the same pathways as Avastin alongside her current alternative health treatments for the next 4 rounds of chemotherapy (until late November). At that point, she will have another CT scan which will determine her next course of action - whether she will continue her current treatment or pursue targeted immunotherapy treatment.

On the 1st of Feb 2024 - we were made aware of a primary cancerous tumour in my bowel that had spread into my liver. After meeting with incredible specialists, this was diagnosed as a rare type of cancer & terminal.
It has been all action since then with chemotherapy starting on the 14th of Feb. My chemo consists of 5 cycles of 21 days. On the first 3 days I receive the chemo at a clinic, then give the chemo 18 days to work its magic.

5 June 2024
Over the last few weeks there have been some awesome initiatives happening organised by our incredibly supportive mates. ‘#moveforwep’ has taken on different shapes and forms. A few weekends ago friends and family laced up the boots in the mighty Hawkes Bay, Auckland, Wanaka, and Waihi beach to name a few! Globally we had friends running in London, Australia, Vietnam, Spain, Aus and even Fiji to support & contribute!
It has been so inspiring and humbling for Emma and I to see it all come together. Friends running further than they ever have before, pregnant ladies joining the action, rowing machines whirring away, even a cheeky full marathon from 2x legends on rollerblades! Never knew our mates were so stacked with athletes!
Last weekend the Taranaki Tennis community came together for a 32 pair winter tennis fundraiser. The day included face painting, kai, a fair few drinks and plenty of quality tennis! A big thank you to Luke and Will who brought the day together, Sean’s words on the action, “it was mean - couldn’t have asked for a better day”. Such an epic effort organising and I know how much it meant to all our whānau so thank you so much again!
We also have Logan “no knees” O’Connell - embarking on a 21km row this Friday at College Rifles rugby club in Auckland. If you’re around we’d love to see you there - action starts at 6pm.
Again, the way people have gone above and beyond has been unbelievable and we cannot thank you all enough 😎🥰

Checking In
17 May 2024
Kia Ora team, Jason and Emma checking in with a short update.
Jason is now into his 5th of 6 chemotherapy cycles. He will have a final scan at the end of the 6th cycle and from here the next step will be confirmed based on the result from the scan. The hope is the cancer will have decreased enough to move into an ‘observation’ period where treatment can seize for a time.
In the meantime, Jason and Emma have been lucky enough to be able to get out of Auckland in between treatments. Last cycle they managed to have 10 days away at the beautiful Coopers Beach! Pictured below - with Stella, the newest addition to the family, the trio managed to walk, swim and even get a bit of a tan during their time up in the winter less north!
Currently the pair (and Stella) are on their way down to Hawkes Bay where a number of friends and whānau will be taking their place in the Hawkes Bay marathon, half marathon and 10km walk/run this Saturday. The support around the event has been amazing from so many both in NZ and abroad - good luck to everyone participating in some shape or form over the coming weeks!

Thank you to everyone who has contributed so generously to support Jase and Emma's fight! We're overwhelmed at the support being received from friends, family, businesses and extended network.
As Jase heads into his 4th (of 6) chemo cycle this week we're stoked to share results from an interim scan have indicated that the tumors have been responding positively to treatment and appear to be reducing in size - we'll hold our breath for the results of the full screening at the end of the initial chemo cycle in 8 weeks.

I have spent months in and out of hospital with no answers. Recently I was diagnosed with a number of rare and life threatening vascular compressions and other comorbidities like POTS that severely affect my health. Because of the compressions I live each day in extreme debilitating pain and am unable to eat or drink. I've been relying on a NJ feeding tube to survive for the last 2 years. I have lost 26kgs because of this illness and am struggling to put on weight. Before all of this happened I was a passionate competitive swimmer and enjoyed life and school. I was meant to be studying at Otago University this year, however I had to pull out under the advice of my doctors. Now I have no quality of life and live each day as a struggle.
I require surgery to fix these compressions however treatment is unavailable in NZ at this time. Due to the severity of the compressions and urgency for treatment I have been advised by doctors over here to look overseas to Germany for surgery. We are in the process of reaching out to Clinic Bel Etage in Düsseldorf and are also exploring other options.
Please help me fundraise for this as it is life changing surgery that will help me get my life back.

7 June 2024
It’s officially been 3 months since my surgery!
Looking back at the last 3 months and beyond there are so many improvements, big or small. I’m managing to go on walks, shopping, seeing friends, I’ve started driving again, going out for coffees. These are all things that before surgery were basically impossible and I haven’t been able to enjoy for almost 3 years so its been really nice being able to do these things and gain some independence and normality back.
I’m still dealing with a bit of pain and fatigue but overall in terms of AVCs I think I can say that so far the surgery was a success. I don’t have any flank pain, no stomach pain, I can eat, walk, stand and my body is just functioning better in general. In no means am I 100% better but I’m only 3 months into what they say is a year long recovery filled with ups and downs so its still early days. It does however mark a milestone where the tissue has healed and I can start using my body more and hopefully build some strength to aid my recovery. I won’t lie this recovery has been a mental challenge but I’m getting there and I’m hopeful things will continue to improve so I can begin to think about work, uni and so much more!
I wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone that’s donated, fundraised and supported me on this journey. None of this would have been possible otherwise, so me and my family are so beyond grateful ❤️❤️

6 weeks post op
25 April 2024
Tuesday marked 6 weeks post op and honestly that time has flown by. I’ve been back home for 2 weeks which has been so nice although a bit tough mentally. The enormity of the surgery and the journey leading up to it has been a lot to process for both me and my family. The flight back from Germany really took it out of me and jet lag on top of that has made it a rough couple of weeks but things are starting to get a bit more normal. I’m managing to go on small walks most days which seems so crazy to me considering 6 weeks ago prior to surgery I could barely walk 100m without feeling like I was going to pass out from POTS symptoms or my leg giving out. For the first time in 2.5 years I’m not on any medication for my heart or pain which is such a great feeling and crazy even to my doctors.
It hasn’t all been positive and I don’t want to give people the wrong idea that I’m 100% better because in reality recovery is and has been tough and definitely not linear. There are days where I have random surgery pains and lots of tiredness as well as back and rib pain which can be hard not to get caught up on. There’s still a long way to go but looking back at where I was before the surgery and even 1-2 weeks post op the improvements are so insane. For now my focus is on recovery and continuing to build on my strength and eating. I look forward to slowly getting back to normality and being able to do more hopefully soon

2 weeks post op - Discharged!
26 March 2024
After 14 days in hospital I was discharged yesterday. The last 2 weeks have been spent trying to gain strength and do things like learn how to sit again to now being able to walk small distances. I won’t lie they were probably some of the toughest days of my life for both me and my family trying to manage pain and also for my body learning how to function in a new way but each day I’m feeling stronger. The care provided by the doctors, nurses and staff at the hospital was amazing and made recovery as smooth as possible, while also making us feel very cared for. It’s still early days but I’m seeing improvements in symptoms that I was suffering pre op which makes the tough days seem worth while. Dad also made it to Germany last week which was a much needed familiar face. We will spend the next 2 weeks in Dusseldorf where I will continue to rest and recover while also being a bit of a tourist before heading back to NZ.
Thank you again to everyone for supporting me and my family on this journey, we couldn’t do it without you 🫶🏻

1 week post op
18 March 2024
Sorry for the lack of updates, it’s been a pretty hectic week. Surgery went ahead as planned on Tuesday last weeks so it’s day 7 post op today. Surgery went well but it’s been a rollercoaster of a week with highs, lows, lots of pain but things are improving. I was sitting up day 2 post op, walking day 3 and now am managing to get around relatively unassisted. I’m also eating, starting slow but so far tolerating it well. The pains been tough but we’ve been well looked after, the nurses, doctors and staff here are all amazing. Recovery will be long, but hopefully small improvements continue this week!

Hello from Germany!
8 March 2024
After a long 26 hours of travelling we made it to Germany on Monday. Since then we’ve explored Frankfurt and Leipzig, taking in bits of pieces of Germany. It’s such a beautiful country although definitely cold!
Yesterday I had my scans with Prof Scholbach. He was super lovely and did a very thorough ultrasound which revealed a number of severe compressions and other problems. It was a lot more than we were expecting and has been a lot to digest but it’s also a good explanation as to why I’m suffering so much pain all the time. It’s also reassuring to know I’m in a place where treatment is available. We will be catching the train to Düsseldorf on Saturday where we will meet with the surgeon and discuss the treatment plan and all going well I will have my surgery on the 12th.
Unfortunately the costs are starting to add up so we have decided to extend the goal date. This will allow us to keep fundraising once I am back from Germany.

1 week to go!! Thank you
25 February 2024
1 week to go! It’s been a busy few weeks organizing last minute forms, medications and everything we need for Germany, but we’re getting there
We wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who has donated so far, without you this wouldn’t be possible. A special thanks to Miles Construction and the businesses associated with them, Luxe & Duke, friends and their delicious baking, flowers, an incredible art exhibition, bbq, and all the other kind donations and fundraisers that have happened over the last few months.
We had such a successful bbq at herne bay rackets last week so thank you to everyone who came along and also to those who gave their time to help out. The amount of people that came down to the club was surreal and it meant so much to me and my family to have friends, family, members and people from all over donating, bidding and supporting us on the final step before Germany.
Also to friends and family for the ongoing love and support we couldn’t do it without you so thank you

Surgery Dates!!
18 January 2024
We have had confirmation of surgery dates!! The scans with Prof Scholbach will be on the 6th of March and then I’ll be admitted on the 11th for surgery on the 12th which I’m feeling both nervous and excited for. It’s been a tough few weeks with pain and other symptoms but getting surgery dates is a big motivator to keep fighting. This wouldn’t be possible without all the donations and support we’ve had and we are so grateful to everyone so thank you!

Great news. I would like to wish you perseverance, patience, strength, which you will definitely need, and of course, good luck. May everything turn out well. I hope that the scan will provide an answer and allow you to choose the most optimal treatment that will help you. I pray for you and wish you recovery with all my heart.
2024 update
1 January 2024
Happy New year!!
It’s been nice taking a break and spending Christmas with family even if it looked a little different this year. So ready to bring on 2024 and everything it has in store. We are looking at the finer details like flights, accommodation and surgery dates which is making it all very real and scary but also a big motivation to keep fighting. Unfortunately we found out that vascular compressions won’t be eligible for HCTP funding which makes the journey a little tougher as it was something we were hopeful for to help cover the costs. Now it means it’s down to fundraising which has been going amazing so far and we are all so grateful for everyone who’s donated. We aren’t there yet but are getting so close. Unfortunately my symptoms are getting worse, so please if you haven’t already share my story around as every little bit counts.

Posted by: Kristin Davis
Just an update- Meila has been accepted on a phase 1 CAR-T cell therapy trial in America. We look to go over in July, Meila will have her Cell procurement (they take a heap of blood) then they make up the CAR-T drug. We only go to America for 2 or 3 days for this then come home. It takes approx 6 weeks to make the drug and then we head back to America for approx 5 weeks. There is serious risks with this therpy, but they have procedures in place that if Meila becomes to sick that they can cancel the CAR-T and she should be fine.
Unfortunately NZ don't cover the cost of the trial and it's completely self funded. Est is $90,000 American ($150,000 nz) plus travel and accommodation. So we will use all the money raised to put towards this and keep raising money and selling off assets. While this is classed as experimental treatment- it has been really successful in other trials and different cancers. So we are excited at what this treatment will offer Meila
We will keep you updated ♥️
P.s this is a photo of Meila playing netball with her team a few weeks ago ... she's doing so well - we feel so lucky she's been given another chance 🙏

Well enough to travel
2 May 2024
Posted by: Kristin Davis
Hi team- we wanted to give a brief update.
Meila is doing really well - her lung surgery to fix her collapsed lung was successful. I am still fighting and trying to get meila treated with EnGeneIC, we take 2 steps forward and 1 step back. But we are currently looking for a Dr to prescribe as we have found a facility to treat her with it. Her oncologist in CHCH is being super supportive and we believe if he could prescribe it he would. But Te whata ora are blocked that.
We managed to take a break to the Gold Coast for 4 days and it was so great to see Meila enjoying things like she used to before Cancer. We have a scan in 2 weeks time. We are nervous about this but based on Meilas determination and fight we feel positive that we might get some positive results from her therapy she is receiving at the moment. We will definitely keep everyone updated.
Thank you again for your kindness and generosity! We are so blessed xxxx love the Davis family

Unfortunately we have still not been given the go ahead from Sydney children's hospital... we have been to Sydney twice with expected start date to only be left waiting. EnGeneIC have the personalized drug waiting for Meila. It's so frustrating and we have wasted so much time waiting for them ! While we have been waiting- Meilas left lung collapsed and filled with 1.7 L of fluid and disease progression. She just had emergency surgery... She is no longer able to travel ... tonight 6pm Newshub TV3 our story is being shared if you want to watch. We will not give up fighting... we need to break through NZ's redtape to give our loved ones a chance 🙏

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

So young and vibrant, a wonderful supportive mum of 3, a loving partner and my rock. She was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer and brca 1 positive. Her fight so courageous, chemo and radiation, surgery. Planning her future, returned to work as an amazing midwife bringing new life in the world. I watched her bloom back to her old self with pride and love as her mum.
September a phone call that shattered our worlds in a million pieces ,""mum I'm gonna die"" the cancer had mastisized into her brain and lungs
No positive outcome, no words of hope from professionals this time.. we can only get time. Time for her maybe to see her little boy start school, her oldest daughters prom, all this depending on raising funds for immunotherapy that's not funded, along side of radiation and chemo, just to give her as long as possible to be here with us all,as a mum to Ella( 15,) Georgia(13) Kingston just 3. To create as many memories as her time allows with her little precious family. To support and guide her girls through their choices of brca1.
My daughter is the bravest, strongest, giving women I know, I see her fragility and feel her burden and pain no young mother should have to endure.
With such a heavy heart we ask for help and more time with her. Because everyday so precious.

This new drug not funded is called a parp inhibitor (olaparib) With the help of my beautiful sister in law and Adams and my amazing family we are absolutely set on getting trying this, which will be coming from Bangladesh as significantly cheaper than our extremely greedy pharmaceutical companies in NZ
I plan on hosting a ""bring a plate"" at a local or semi local park somewhere soon so everyone who wants to see me can while I'm still here and capable. So watch this space for a date and time. Maybe it will be a teddy bears picnic! How do you explain to your just turned 5 year old what's going on, mummy will be in the stars soon? How do I train my stage 5 clinger for life without me? If you want to donate still and able to, anything leftover after paying for these drugs will be to make memories with my 3 kids and husband and family or left for my kids so they will be looked after when I am gone.
I cannot say how appreciative we are of every little cent we've received already throughout this journey. I'll always be mindblown at the love and kindness that's touched our hearts and will always be grateful. Thankyou everyone, feeling the love all around 🥰

Not so good update (1/2)
10 April 2024
Posted by: Karrissa Ririkore
Update (1/2) - because I've been tired and to be honest hard to know what to say we're devastated to say the least- so bluntly :
Drs have given me 3 months, I've had multiple seizures, closest we thought was 4 days apart but today 12 hours apart! So with that and the recent CT scan showing massive spread in the lungs everywhere. New breast tumour they're leaving alone (coz what's the point cutting that out right?!) my prognosis is pretty bloody grim. Too much cancer in the lungs to radiate and no more to brain incase of necrosis. On an oral chemo but the last 3 chemos have failed me so guess I'm a bit resistant there now!
I'm feeling like absolute crap today because my household all have a cold so makes breathing and coughing , hell even moving hard work! Had a spot of radiation yesterday to help with the pain on a small part of pleural lining which has been awful to deal with
Anyway still holding onto one more Xmas with my babies, just 1 more is all I ask for!
There's 1 more drug I'm holding onto to try and get me there. Of COURSE not funded in NZ (Funded for brca1 ovarian cancer in NZ, but I have brca1 breast cancer😂🙄🙄🙄) also funded pretty much everywhere else in the world for breast cancer just not NZ . Never NZ . OH the tax my husband and I have paid and the hours and hours I've devoted to the health system here underpaid and overworked as a midwife to have it kick me right in the ass when I've needed it's help back just breaks us

Hey guys thought I'd do a quick update for those who are following my ""journey""!
Immunotherapy seems to have stopped working, I've had a couple seizures in the last 2 months and now under hospice care who are amazing and have my pain under control. I am trialling a new (unfunded of course) drug called temozolomide for the brain Mets and on oral chemo for the lungs. I'm also on anti seizure meds so hopefully no more of those! There is some spread and growth but it's to be expected for stage 4, and I'm not planning on going anywhere anytime soon! One day there will be a cure I am hopeful! I recently just got married to the love of my life and have such a beautiful life with a beautiful support system and amazing children and family, I am blessed and love my life . I am thankful for everyone's donations this last year. I am truly blown away everytime I think about the generosity of everyone, even complete strangers. Life is beautiful, growing old is a blessing. Make the most of the amazingness of life. It truly is a gift .. I will try to be better with updates xx

Hey! Thought I should do a quick update. Sadly bout a month ago 3 new spots had popped up on scan in my brain and I need to do radiation on these (starting next week) in Palmerston North. Last time I had this I was quite sick but I'm hoping because these are targeted rather than whole brain fry, I will not be so unwell. The body has remained stable with no new spots - so I think the immunotherapy has for sure helped that everyone rallied around and donated for! Just need to get the brain sorted and I'll be right to carry on. Immunotherapy is on hold for couple weeks till radiation is over then start back on it again. Im a fighter and not planning on going anywhere. Lessons still to teach and definetly to learn. Thanks everyone x

A solo Mum to two amazing teenagers Maddi and Jackson, and a daughter, sister, aunty, friend and teacher to many others.
Becki is known for her sense of humour, big smile, positive attitude and beautiful outlook on life.
Becki has been hit with the hard news, Stage 4 Cancer. A diagnosis no one wants to hear - there’s chemotherapy treatment to help keep the cancer at bay, but no real cure. There are medications (Erbitux is an example)- and they aren’t funded. They’re expensive and may help extend her life and give Becki the opportunity to live longer and have time with her children, family, partner and friends to make more memories.
Becki has inspired many children and their families while teaching at Hillcrest Normal, Marian, St. Peters and Southwell schools more recently. Becki’s enthusiasm for life, and her motivation to show others how to be a good human is evident in the way she treats others, always helping and generous and making the most of each moment.
Let’s do what we can to get Becki the best treatment to give her more time, so she can continue to live life to the full ❤️

Becki’s Update
19 April 2024
Hi all, just thought i’d check in, let you know what’s happening. Round 4 of gold plated $ drug took place on Weds followed by Round 7 of Chemo! Knocked me round a bit more this time - as it accumulates and my immunity is getting wiped out feeling the pinch - But Becki bounce will not be held down for long! Had 3 rockstar Chemo Juice Team members join me this week. Shout out to my Dad Glenn who was there by my side and rocked the F**k Cancer hat x Next scan after round out so i’m praying the crackjuice is doing it’s thing and all the other extras i’m working on - Once again- so much gratitude and love to everyone helping me fight this fight ❤️ Love Becki 💛

Now it’s time to keep going and take this unwanted Gangsta down!!! - Stage 4 No cure they said…. Not on my freaking watch! Picked the wrong opponent!

Friday Update
15 March 2024
Hi all, just updating you that I had my first scan today since starting treatment. I have my follow up on Tuesday with my Oncologist to go into detail but… He is an absolute gem and eased my weekend of worry with a text to say the scan is better than the last one I had pre treatment! I will so take that good news. It means something is working in my favour right now! Beyond relieved. While the fight has only just begun and she’s a long road ahead - I will take every ounce of positivity. 🥰 Happy weekend lovelies x Becki

28 February 2024
Hi all, well I have arrived at the ripe old age of 43! Talk about spoilt and feeling the love. ❤️ Honestly, you all are the best. Just an update, I start a new drug alongside Chemo as of next weds. The aim is to work alongside the looney juice and hopefully add some extra time🤞🤞🤞 without your support, I would not have the ability to fund this drug. So please know every single one of you have contributed to me being able to afford it for the 20 cycles I’ve been given so far. - I have my first Scan next Thursday since starting treatment to see if there has been shrinkage in the Lymph-nodes and Tumour- Fingers and Toes crossed for some positive news rather than the bad stuff! On Saturday Les Mills are putting on a fundraiser - Pedal for a Purpose - 8 Hours of cycle classes! I’m going to have a crack at a class myself! Wish us all luck x - Forever grateful. - Becki ❤️❤️❤️

Sh*t Sambo continues…
20 February 2024
Hi team, just giving you an update. Had a little more of a slap across the face yesterday when I saw an Oncologist about adding the targetted treatment to add alongside chemo. The Dr gave me more insights on my cancer. 1. That it’s agressive 2. I am in the 10% of people that have this rare form of Bowel cancer. 3. Chemo is not always effective on my type of cancer! 4. Create my bucketless💩 my happy vibe took a hit, the tears flowed and I just thought when are we going to catch a break! But… I got up today, thought about all the things i’m grateful for and put my armour back on! A walk with one of my faves helped too! Ebs and flows in this totally uncontrollable journey! 🥹

Drug update
16 February 2024
Hi team! So a bit of dumb news yesterday that sadly after making it to 2nd round of IGENZ testing, I was not a match for the drug we were hopeful for. However, there is a consolation prize that I am meeting a specialist to discuss on Monday and hopefully add to my treatment plan! - Still costs an absolute fortune so this Give a Little and all of your donations are making it possible to start treatment. Without it- No chance I could afford it. So to all of you, I am sooooooo eternally grateful. I will continue to keep my head in the game, make the most of this life I have and will fight like a beast! 💪❤️ Becki 🌻🌻🌻

💫 2 chemo rounds down and still smiling
11 February 2024
It was chemo round two last week and Becki has been a legend, some niggly side effects but as usual Becki is taking it all in her stride.
The aim is for the chemo to work its magic on the lymph nodes and to shrink the tumour in her colon.
Becki had an equivocal result for match testing of the drug which we’re funding for - so additional testing has been sent to Auckland, send your prayers for positive results back this week.
A week of beautiful cleaning fairies, eats and treats and some gorgeous photos of family and Steve.
We’re heading into Becki’s 43rd Birthday week - and we’re so close to our funding target.
We started the Birthday celebrations with a night at Synthony in the Domain in Auckland - and apart from a few bumps into Mr Pickles (picc line for administering chemo drugs) and blisters; maybe partly due to my walking tour around Albert park which was not in the direction of our hotel. We all had an amazing day and night with great people.
Chemo round 3 is on the 21st February
The battle of the cancer continues 🌻

Kylie asks
Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

Prior to Pam becoming severely unwell in August 2021, she was active, adventurous, had a wonderful small business and her whole life ahead of her.
Now, in March 2024, after a grueling 2.5yrs and counting, Pam is fighting for her life and finally has some answers.
Pam has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (classical; cEDS). EDS is a genetic connective tissue disease that affects her entire body. Pam is severely affected and suffers from co-occurring conditions, one of which is a confirmed diagnoses of the rare Abdominal Vascular Compression Syndromes (AVCS).
Specifically, Pam suffers from NCS (Nutcracker Syndrome), MTS (May-Thurner Syndrome), MALS (Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome) and SMAS (Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome).
EDS and AVCS are extremely misunderstood in NZ and there is little to no treatment for it here. Health insurance is also of no use.
Pam battles daily with debilitating abdominal & pelvic pain, fatigue, migraines, tinnitus and nausea to name a few. She is malnourished and has been tube-fed via different methods since April 2022. Pam's quality of life is so reduced, she can barely make it out of bed these last few months. She is deteriorating quickly.
The only option is to undergo life-saving surgery in Germany, which comes at a huge cost.
For her full story, please search Facebook for ""Pam’s Positively Full Life"", as the space available in this description is very limited.

We can’t quite believe that in only 3 months we’ve made it just over half way to our goal. It is no small feat and such a phenomenal effort by Pam, Jon, family, friends and complete strangers doing anything they can to help us, ‘thank you’ you will simply never be enough, but we are thankful nonetheless and feel incredibly grateful and humbled for everyone’s support.
We’re are updating our Givealittle goal to reflect the donations Pam & Jon have received privately, which includes the many events, auctions, raffles and other private donations. So with that $35k received privately, our updated Givealittle goal is $155k.
Pam & Jon’s retirement funds are that much closer to being withdrawn under hardship, hopefully only a couple of weeks to go and then we can get onto booking the travel arrangements to get Pam and mum (Joy) to Germany.
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support ❤️❤️❤️

Wow, in only a few hours we’ve received so many amazing donations from supportive people around New Zealand. We are incredibly grateful to you all helping us reach our goal for Pam.
While Pam and Jon are still waiting for news on withdrawing their retirement funds, they have pencilled in a date for surgery next month (July 2024). There is light at the end of the tunnel!

Further funds hopeful, and Pam's daily battle
21 May 2024
Pam & Jon would also like to share they have applied to withdraw under hardship their retirement (superannuation) funds from their time living in Australia. The paperwork is monstrous, and very specific. They've finally gathered it all and submitted, so now the up to 4-week wait begins to see if they are successful.
If they are, while this will mean Pam will be able to undergo surgery this year, it does put them under huge financial pressure for the rest of their (and their kids) lives. Fundraising is still essential, so we will keep going for as long as we can and even after surgery, if required.
We still have incredible offers of donations/products/services/vouchers etc. from businesses and with fundraising becoming a full time job for Jon and some other family members, we simply can't manage it all at once, so we will need to spread it out a little more. Or, if you are someone with capacity to run your own fundraising effort for Pam, we are so grateful. We are more than happy to offer photos/flyers that we've had previously created.
Pam is still getting worse, she is really struggling with the pain and every day is more challenging than the last. But she keeps her spirits high, she puts on a brave face, her ""mask"", for her boys, her family and herself. Just know that under it all is pain and other horrific symptoms most of us cannot fathom. We are all working hard to make this surgery possible and thank you all for sharing and keeping Pam in your thoughts - xoxo, Renee

Fundraising event success & more to come!
21 May 2024
The last few weeks have been jam packed full of fundraising efforts, from those organised by us and others very generously organised by kind people all on their own. Beats by Bingo in Matamata raised $4k and Pam's Positively Fun Night of Trivia raised just over $4.5k! Thank you so, so much to everyone who attended, bought raffle tickets and gave other donations. Pam was determined to attend the trivia night, and here is a photo of her, Jon, Benny & Ollie with their MC Matt from Coromandel's More FM.
We also had Madam Moo's ""buy a coffee for a donation"" day, Natalie Waugh Photography's 2x mini fundraisers, Leigh & Tracey's ""Egg Sandwiches & Cupcakes* Mt Maunganui fundraiser walk, Sassy Sadie's voucher fundraiser, ""Pam's Life"" bespoke bracelets, mulch & firewood raffles and so many more amazing people doing heartwarming things to help Pam reach her goal. We cannot do this without all of your support and simply don't know how we are going to properly express our thanks to you all.
Coming up in June will be an ""Auction Night"" at Flat White Cafe in Waihi Beach, so keep an eye out on our Facebook page for info on that!

An update from the surgeon in Germany, and a Trivia Fundraising Night!
5 May 2024
Hi everyone! Thank you for all your unwavering support. We wanted to let you all know that Pam is in contact with the specialist surgeon in Germany, getting paperwork together for all the moving parts, in the hopes she can have the surgery this year.
What she did happen to find out during that contact, is after he reviewed her scans that were performed here in NZ, she does in fact have all 4 AVCS compressions (NCS (Nutcracker Syndrome), MTS (May-Thurner Syndrome), MALS (Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome) and SMAS (Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome)). It's not too much of a surprise given Pam's symptoms and how much she understands her own health. But it does show how superior this incredible surgeon is compared to the knowledge here in NZ, for him to diagnose all 4 from just looking at the NZ scan (whereas here in NZ, she was only diagnosed with 2).
There is a further specialist also in Germany with far-superior technology for these types of scans, so Pam is in touch with him as well. Both this specialist, and the surgeon, work closely together for patients like Pam.
On another note, if you're keeping up with Pam's socials you will see that our Beats by Bingo FUNdraiser for Pam in Matamata next week SOLD OUT! We're so, so grateful for that and can't wait for the event.
If you missed out, Pam's Positively Fun Night of Trivia is happening in Waihi Beach on Saturday 18 May at 6.30pm - 10pm. Check out the flyer for more info!

Part 3 - FUNdraiser Beats by Bingo in Matamata flyer & Pam's surgery
9 April 2024
The flyer is attached to this update, sorry I can't put more than one image on each update.
Now onto an update of Pam’s surgery journey. After hours and hours of research into the different options available (2-3 surgeons that we’re aware of), Pam has decided Germany is best suited to her. All recommendations point to ultrasound scans first by Prof Thomas Scholbach, the “gold standard” of this type of scan in the world, and he is located in Leipzig, Germany. The surgeon she has chosen, Dr Sandmann, highly regarded as the best in his field and has been doing these surgeries the longest, dealing with all types of AVCS, is located in Dusseldorf. He and Prof Scholbach work closely together. The travel will be brutal on Pam regardless, but to stay within the same country and area of Europe will be just that little bit easier for her. She is in talks with both of these medical professionals, so progress is being made.
Thank you again everyone for your support, please keep sharing Pam’s story and jump on the Facebook page to keep updated 😊
With Love, Renee xoxo

WOW, what a 14-days it has been since we started this Givealittle page for Pam! (Part 1)
9 April 2024
We are absolutely blown away by the support and generosity of New Zealanders, people abroad, our friends, family, and communities. THANK YOU from the bottom of our hearts. Pam has a lot of fighting spirit in her and she will not give up hope. For herself, for her boys, her family.
To give all our wonderful supporters an update on where things are at with Pam, if you’re not already following Pam’s Positively Full Life on Facebook and/or positively.full.life on Instagram, we highly recommend you do! We post updates regularly which include media interviews we have done or are coming up, as well as highlight stories of other Kiwis in the same battle as Pam. We also have other fun raffles and fundraising efforts happening, including an upcoming event in our hometown where we grew up as a family in Matamata.
So a snapshot of how things are going:
• Our sister Alaina ran a “Lucky Lotto” on Facebook and raised a whopping $720! + the $200 prize was donated back to Pam as well, so $920 total!
• Rosalie Liddle Crawford wrote an article on Sun Live after speaking with Jon: https://www.sunlive.co.nz/news/339923-helping-pam-to-get-expensive-surgery.html?fbclid=IwAR0bPBgfIF4bdoF6935GpnkhaEVvJI5H54CkglxFMLTSZuWLYXtcy8gMd5s_aem_AdLkyMcq9_cnQ10vjfD8SrEfQerW9IjoV-NJCT7yYAEofeFgHK7npB2P6knW_CwjYSkhyf-cGAYCgQwkEt9jlL1H

I have been livestreaming my journey the last month or so on a gaming platform called Twitch. I’ve had a rare neurological condition called complex regional pain syndrome or CRPS for the last eight years. My CRPS developed after carpal tunnel surgery on both hands over 8 years ago. CRPS is rated the most painful condition on the McGill pain scale, higher than the pain from childbirth or amputation. I would know I’ve had two kids naturally... CRPS is nicknamed the suicide disease: it causes severe nerve pain and there is no standardised treatment in New Zealand. Doctors in here don’t know what to do to with me. CRPS feels like being wrapped in barbed wire, while being set on fire and then electrocuted. It can change as quickly as the lights on traffic lights. One minute you can be smiling dealing with the pain and the next second it’s excruciating, and you’re paralysed. In the last few days, I have lost my ability to walk, and I am now in a wheelchair... I can feel it spreading inside my body now... and I can feel it happening fast. There is no proper treatment in New Zealand for CRPS.. Please help me, I can’t be this pain much longer it’s more than anyone should have to live with. I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy.. I deserve a chance to have some quality of life, to be able to hug and kiss my children again and my kids deserve a mum. This is no life…
Use of funds

I face some huge fears of mine the other day when I talk to a journalist for the New Zealand Herald. I was actually an old school friend of mine so that made the whole process a little bit easier but is very hard putting out there to the world like that Part of what happened to me. I feel like it was only the top of the iceberg because Siri is such a big one but I feel amazing now for having spread more awareness about this disease. Because it just isn’t given much time because usually people don’t want to hear about it. It’s too hard it’s pain and people don’t understand it . Especially me most people see me and they think that I look fine it can’t be that bad you know that I must be exaggerating. And that’s how the medical system has treated me here for years and it’s traumatised me. I’ve linked the article and all my social media and you can also find it if you just search CPM and google it seems to come up first or jump onto the New Zealand Herald website and this is the title below; Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: Kiwi mum with ‘most painful condition’ seeks life-changing treatment

New Update 26/6
26 June 2024
Hi friends, we have had to update our goal again, as we all know things are expensive, and new costs keep coming up. For example... I need to get a wheelchair I can take to America and that I can use on my own. It is not currently safe for me to be in a wheelchair where someone has to push me, and as I can't push myself as my CRPS is based in my hands then I effectively can't be left alone. There has been a couple of times recently I have had to be home alone, and it becomes quite scary when you literally can't leave your bed or even get yourself to the bathroom. We are also having trouble with various agencies we have been going to for support (such as for some home help or mirimiri or funding for a wheelchair or an OT) have been saying that as CRPS is classed as a neurological condition, it is not covered by general disability... We are facing hurdles everywhere we go. But we are trying to stay positive we will reach our goal. I don't know what else to do. The alternative is too scary to consider... thank you so, so much to everyone who has donated so far. It means the world to us <3 Also, here is a photo of me in my bed from last week, with the man who is holding it all together. The one who makes me smile and gives my life meaning and joy through all this pain....

Update 24/6
24 June 2024
Thank you so much to everyone for your support so far with my fundraiser. My family and I are eternally grateful for every dollar towards our goal to get me better. We have had to update the goal to $60,000- this is due to a few things but mainly the fact that I need more infusions than we originally first thought. So that costs more money. We have pretty solid plans set in place with Dr Hana in Florida. He is one of the world leading CRPS specialists and has done some of the most infusions for CRPS. I’ve also extended the closing date of the fundraiser for another few weeks to give us enough time to get the money together we need to go. Thank you again to everyone who has donated so far <3

Fundraising goal
14 June 2024
From what we have calculated so far $50,000 should get me a course of 5-10 infusions and appointments with one of the leading CRPS specialists in the world (he is based in Florida), flights, visas, I might need a nurse there, a wheelchair and accessible accommodation.

Wheelchair and treatment plans
14 June 2024
Thank you so much to everyone who has donated so far. yesterday we picked up a wheelchair because I now can’t even walk to the bathroom. We have found a doctor in Florida and we are in talks with them at the moment. We are still in the process of gathering costs but we are thinking we are going to need at least $50,000. we’re selling our cars, we’re getting a credit card and if we have to we will sell our house to get there. Despite all this and the excruciating pain I am in I feel strong and I feel like I can fight this. Thank you all so much for your support <3

30 June 2024
Hi Everyone
Well the week was a little topsy turby.
We got through to Wednesday for jacks weekly bloods & ops in Nelson. They were a little out of sorts and then he developed another temperature that spiked very high 38s.
We were able to coordinate with CHOC & Nelson & Thankfully get steroids form Golden Bay community health that helped to control the temperature over the next few days. Because of this we were able to fly to Christchurch this afternoon and prepare for hospital for the week. Jack will be admitted to the CHOC ward with high care on stand by as a precaution. Jack has stopped the BRAF gene inhibitors for the next few days if not longer so we can continue with the ‘A’ plan of Keytruda.
As long as jacks body accepts the Keytruda this will give him the best possible chance to fight back at the extremely aggressive melanoma.
As we know the future is uncertain at this point and we will know after a few more Keytruda treatments as to what direction things are heading in.
I’ve talked about the storm and it’s fair to say it never cleared as we were standing in the eye of it. Now it’s hitting us face on and Jack is holding his ground digging his feet in and leaning into it and we are all right there beside him helping him give it all.We are so very proud of Jack but also our ever loving community that work relentlessly to help especially this week with the River Inn Hunting Competition fundraiser , we are so very grateful.
Thank you

Weekly update (pushing forward)
23 June 2024
Hi Everyone
Last week jack had another temperature , the treatment & plan worked well from home without having to visit hospital. After that wee bump We have had a reasonably good week.
Jack had his routine bloods & ops on Wednesday and they have all came back to the realms of where they need to be which is also good.After his check up he had a chest xray & ultrasound on his entire abdomen.
We had a zoom meeting Friday with the CHOC team & Nelson team to discuss results from the ultrasound & xray. The BRAF gene inhibitors are doing their job, This means they have stopped the melanoma from spreading further. This is still a ‘B’ option in treatment meaning temporary Because no matter what the melanoma does fined a way passed the inhibitors over time. Now jack has stabilised to a point where he is holding some health for now. We are heading to Christchurch to the CHOC team to revisit the Keytruda as an ‘A’ option treatment that actually fights and kills the melanoma cells. He will be admitted to hospital and monitored very closely over the week. We know now from our last visit to Christchurch how wide spread the melanoma has traveled. We are under no illusion, jack is up against things and with the keytruda stands his best chance. The journey will be a long one & together we are standing strong and he not only has a massive medical team behind him but also a massive family,friends & supporters base from far and wide. We are forever grateful “ALWAYS IN THE FIGHT”

Weekly update ( boring is good )
16 June 2024
Hi Everyone
Well it has been a very slow week even slightly boring. Which is exactly what we needed for a change after such a hectic few months. We had jacks weekly appointment for bloods and ops on Wednesday at Nelson Hospital.
With the results showing an overall stable test.
Unfortunately early yesterday afternoon (Saturday)Jack’s temperature spiked again , but this time we were prepared for it and have started the doctors process and treatment from home. He is still immune compromised so we are working through this as a family and doing our best to avoid as many possible complications as we can , also keeping family life as normal as we can.
We would like to acknowledge our amazing community for the Fundraiser on today.
The golf Ambrose fundraiser & auction.
We are so very very humbled & overwhelmed by the support of all the businesses involved the community support, all the teams that have entered & everyone who is involved with the auction from organising through to attending we are forever grateful & thankful of your kindness & support in helping with Jacks Journey.
And also everyone that has donated via give a little we can’t thank you enough.
Humanity is strong and together we are strong for jack on his journey standing there with him the whole way “ALWAYS IN THE FIGHT”
Thank you all from the bottom of our hearts
Love the Holland Family ❤️

Update ( patchy week )
9 June 2024
Hi Everyone
Well we had an ok 6 days at home before we needed to re visit Nelson Hospital.
Jack developed a temperature that required hospital admission to sort out what was happening.
After a few different tests they took him off the BRAF gene inhibitors to bring his temperature down, and restarted it once he is ok unfortunately at some stage his white blood cell count has bottomed out.
This means he is extremely susceptible to infection, bugs, cold & flu including Covid.
Jack immune system is gone and we would appreciate if we had no visitors and unannounced visitors. We can’t stress this enough.
We have a weekly meeting with the oncology team on Wednesday this coming week and hopefully things will finally plateau out for now.
We are right in amongst the storm & getting hammered from every angle but we are standing strong with Jack and holding tight. We are due for some sunshine very soon.
We would like to thank every person , family member and anyone that is following Jacks journey. We appreciate you and appreciate your kind words of love and support , together we are strong. “ALWAYS IN THE FIGHT”
Love the Holland Family ❤️

Update (first week home)
2 June 2024
Hi Everyone,
Well it’s been a fairly quiet week which is well needed by Jack and the rest of us.
We had a weekly visit to Nelson on Wednesday which involved taking bloods , doing observations and removing his PICC line from his arm.
We had a good talk with the CHOC team in Christchurch the same day and they have had the meeting with the adult oncology team.
They are happy with Jacks progress over the last 2 weeks and we are heading for scans in 2 more weeks and are looking to stop the BRAF gene inhibitors and revisit the Keytruda.
Unfortunately we have hit a foot trip and Jack came down with a temperature last night. He did feel better this morning but as the day went on it came back.
It has hit the hospital mark and we have arrived in Nelson Hospital this afternoon to monitor it and sort out what’s going on. Hopefully just precautionary.
It is taking a bit for us all to get our heads around just how compromised his immune system is at the moment. To put it bluntly he is extremely fragile. We will know more soon.
We would like to acknowledge every single person & family for their ongoing support and kind words we are very grateful “AlWAYS IN THE FIGHT”
Love The Holland Family ❤️

Update ( Discharged & Home )
26 May 2024
Hi Everyone
It’s been 10 days since “Hell Week” Wednesday 15th & Thursday 16th May when jacks body was failing & we had the awful meeting.
On Monday 20th May Jack was moved from the higher care & intensive care ward back to the CHOC ward for continuous monitoring for bloods & fluids that his body was retaining.
Jacks body was picking up as the week progressed but the obvious signs are there that he & his body have been punished like no healthy persons body should be.
On Friday morning Jack was officially discharged from Christchurch Hospital. We celebrated by going to watch a private Captain’s Run with the Crusaders and attended their game Saturday with very Special VIP front row seats and a 1 on 1 meet & greet after the game.
We left Christchurch this morning after 3 weeks and a life changing diagnosis.
From here: There are a lot of important pills Jack needs to take & we will be doing weekly visits to Nelson Hospital for bloods & things under the watchful eyes of the Christchurch oncology Department.
It will take a while for Jack to recover somewhat back to stable before we can revisit the “Keytruda” in a few months time with his already compromised immune system.
We are very Blessed to have all your support , love & kindness we are “Forever Grateful & ALWAYS IN THE FIGHT”
Love from the Holland Family ❤️

Update (unmeasurable news)
20 May 2024
Hi Everyone.
How & where to begin.
It has been an extremely hard week for jack & his family to say the least.
We have been to Hell & back.
After been admitted to hospital early Friday morning 10th May jacks body started to crash
For reasons that were unclear.
After been released from the “ Higher Care & Intensive Care Wards” we now know Jack has Stage 4 Advanced Melanoma.
Because of this the oncology team has stopped the Keytruda for now & are focusing on Targeted gene therapy (BRAF gene inhibitors) they may revisit the keytruda later once jack is stable. Tracy & I have had the overwhelming meeting with the heads of the oncology team to discuss jacks survival strategies. Because Jack has Stage 4 Advanced Melanoma cancer that is wide spread,
Pembrolizumab “Keytruda” & BRAF gene therapy is now funded. The team has also advised us we may need the give a little fund down the track So this will go towards our Family’s travel expenses, accommodation ect but most importantly Jack’s quality of life.
We are so grateful to the CHOC team , the higher care team & the ICU team for their work and compassion during this extremely stressful and challenging time which Jack and his family have had. “ALWAYS IN THE FIGHT”
We would also like to thank all our family & friends, community and wider community, people from far and wide for your support, love & kind words we are forever grateful.
Love the Holland Family ❤️

Weekly update (immunotherapy week)
12 May 2024
Hi Everybody,
Well it’s been an extremely difficult week to say the least.
Last Sunday when we arrived in Christchurch jack started feeling unwell and nauseated. We had the meeting Monday & jack started the immunotherapy on Tuesday come Wednesday he was still nauseated from Sunday (before the treatment) he has hardly eaten anything all week and is extremely lethargic & unwell,Jack was admitted back to hospital Friday morning where they have put him on an I V and ran a few tests and did an xray of his chest to discover he has a chest infection under lying, he is on antibiotics to help the chest infection, he has also had an abdomen ultrasound and will need further scans as it is inconclusive. He will be getting the scans tomorrow but for now we are still in Christchurch hospital and they are treating his chest infection. The immunotherapy treatment went well with no obvious side effects or reactions (chest infection began before treatment) it has not been a good week and there is lots going on in jacks body right now surgery recovery, treatment, chest infection ect , he is certainly in the fight and standing in the middle of the storm we are holding his hand and standing right beside him. Our Family would like to thank everyone for their ongoing support, love & kind words we are very grateful ❤️

Weekly update (Christchurch hospital)
5 May 2024
Hi Everyone
A fairly quiet week leading up to today.
Fridays meeting with the head of the surgery team was to remove the stitches and discuss the results from the lymph nodes.
There were 73 lymph nodes removed in total and 6 of them had heavy traces of cancer in them.
Because of this the surgery team has put forward to the oncology team that jack should have radiation therapy as well as immunotherapy.
Not the greatest news but it is another form of treatment to help stop the disease spreading.
We have arrived in Christchurch this morning and have a meeting tomorrow to discuss immunotherapy & radiation treatment.
Some blood work & of course lots of paper work.
We won’t know any more until our meeting tomorrow.
We are in Christchurch till Thursday at this stage and all going well we will head home with Jack having had his first immunotherapy treatment done at least.
Again we would like to thank everyone for their love , support & donations for making Jack’s treatment possible. We are so very humbled and extremely grateful for everyone’s help ❤️ lots of love from the Holland Family ❤️

Weekly update (after the operation)
21 April 2024
Hi Everyone
Jack had his “Neck dissection & lymph node removal” operation on Friday 19th.
It was approximately 6 hours with his right side neck muscle been removed his right side shoulder nerve removed & all the lymph nodes on his right side removed. He took a little while to come out of recovery due to his pain level (to be expected). He has been quite sleepy but in good spirits. He has been eating and also had a good walk around the ward today ( must keep moving for the 2 neck drains to work properly)
He also had 1 neck drain taken out with 1 still in and will be for a few more days.
We are expecting to be going home Wednesday the 24th on the 6th day at this stage and all going well. All the doctors have been communicating and have organised a plan for two weeks after Jack’s surgery to give him a bit of time to recover. The plan is to head to Christchurch 6th of May for approximately 4 days to start his immunotherapy. That will be the start of a 12month course of keytruda.
I will keep you all posted as Jack’s journey unfolds. Thank you all for the messages of love & support we so extremely grateful for your donations, support & positive energy ❤️ lots of love the Holland Family ❤️

Firstly Thank you for all your donations so far we are extremely grateful for how fast people have rallied together and are raising the funds needed for jack , much love everybody ❤️ (also I do respond personally to every donation made it is not computer generated ❤️ Thank you so much).
We Received the Results yesterday from jacks biopsy last week unfortunately not what we wanted to hear , they have found a large amount of the cancer in his lymph nodes in his neck and now we are faced with an extremely hard decision of major surgery first to remove the lymph nodes or immunotherapy first and monitor the progress, either way immunotherapy will happen. The surgery will be a major procedure with big risks involved. We have a meeting next week with the plastics team to go over everything involved and plenty of questions. Scary times for our family but we are staying strong for our jack with all the love and support from everyone ❤️

She cannot eat or drink and suffers from vomiting, pain and other horrific symptoms.
Julia is a bright, determined 15yo with an amazing attitude despite her terrible health challenges. Julia loves school and is a loyal, fun friend and sibling. She used to do competitive Cheerleading, tumbling, violin, debating and babysitting and helped teach younger Cheer teams. All this has been taken from her by her health issues.
Since March 2023, Julia has been in and out of hospital, sometimes for weeks with medical instability. She has endured dozens of horrific invasive procedures and relies on a nasal tube for all hydration and nutrition. She has very little quality of life.
Julia’s symptoms are caused by multiple abdominal vascular compression syndromes and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (a rare connective tissue disorder). Vascular surgeons in NZ, Germany and the US agree that Julia needs surgery asap. The longer her blood vessels are compressed, the more her organs are damaged. This highly specialized surgery is unavailable in NZ but an expert in Germany can operate her. The surgeon (who has treated over a dozen Kiwis) is confident his surgery will enable her to eat and drink, resolve her other symptoms and restore quality of life.
Julia is often told how she inspires people with her incredible resilience and positive attitude. All she wants is to go to school again, do her hobbies and have fun with her friends. Please help her.

She had been a high achieving student, with a natural talent for art, drama, and writing. She has since had to withdraw from school due to severe pain, constant nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, with having had significant weight loss. Almost 4 years later she now relies on a naso-jejeunal (NJ) tube for nutrition and hydration.
Last year Maia was diagnosed with Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a genetic connective tissue disorder that affects the collagen production in the body and causes a lot of co-morbidities. Maia has recently been diagnosed with a number of rare conditions that are contributing to her pain and gastrointestinal symptoms which fall into the category of Abdominal Vascular Compression Syndromes (AVCs).
The AVCS that have been confirmed are SMAS, MALS, Nutcracker Syndrome, and May Thurner Syndrome. We have been advised by Maia's vascular surgeon that it is necessary for Maia to have surgery to release these compressions, to return and improve blood flow to her organs (particularly her kidney), allow her to eat and drink again, and to give her the opportunity to live a normal life.
Unfortunately there is currently no treatment or surgery options available in Aotearoa for Maia, and Germany is our best, and most cost effective option. It does still come with a significant cost however and we are unable to fund this ourselves. Without fundraising to cover the costs, Maia will not be able to get this surgery.

10 June 2024
Kia ora e te whānau, a very delayed update to our fundraising progress 🙂
Things have been a little hectic recently on our end, so apologies for the lack of updates! Most of May was spent traveling to and from various medical appointments (which all seemed to be booked for May), as well as the usual day-to-day family life.
Maia quietly celebrated her 18th birthday with family and close friends. This has been a bittersweet milestone for Maia, as it has not brought with it the independence that it would for most people.
Not much has changed in terms of Maia's health, and we continue to try to maintain her nutrition and hydration as well as possible. Our fantastic GP has been an incredible help in this area, and has been supporting Maia with IV hydration.
Our fundraising efforts have been slow but steady, with approx $1500 raised externally. Included in these funds are a generous donation from the Ashhurst RSA Women's Section, a number of donations from a lovely Ashhurst resident, and the proceeds of multiple raffles organised by my wonderful mum and her work colleagues. This brings our fundraising goal down to $160,500, which I will update.
We hope to have more fundraising events to update you with soon. Thank you all for your continued support! It means the world to us 💜

Update- Car Show fundraiser was a huge success!
13 April 2024
Hi everyone, just a wee update. Firstly I just want to say a massive thank you to everyone who has donated and/or shared Maia's Givealittle over the past week. The support we have received has been incredible, and we are so very grateful to you all.
Secondly I'd just like to share the final total that was raised from the amazing fundraiser that was held in Tokomaru last Friday- $8051!!! It was a great night with a huge turnout, and the organisors did such an amazing job. As these funds were raised separately to the givealittle, they will be put aside and taken from the total that needs to be raised, meaning that our fundraising goal is now $162,000. We will continue to do this following any external fundraising that is arranged.
Once again, thank you. Your support means so much to us. Please continue to share our page far and wide, and pop over to our Facebook or Instagram pages to follow Maia's journey.
Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou,
Rebecca

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best.

In Late November 2022 he was diagnosed with a very rare & aggressive cancer - DSRCT Sarcoma. Which is located in the abdomen.
Roman endured months of pain and discomfort while working ,eventually forcing him to wear his tool belt around his neck. Multiple trips to A&E and to the hospital resulted in being discharged prematurely, after conducting many different tests. Once the seriousness of the situation was realised, a PET scan showed the tumour that began in his abdomen, had now spread to his liver & spleen resulting in a stage 4 cancer diagnosis.
Now facing the fight for his future, Roman has his second round of chemo under way with many more cycles lined up. With his typical calm humble nature, he maintains a strong positive attitude, that is inspiring.
He is a genuine kind loving man - all the qualities that make for an amazing partner, son, brother & friend.
From all of us that can't imagine a world without him, we appeal to YOU to join us in showing support while he is on this journey & unable to continue working as the talented builder we know him to be.

From Roman with love
11 January 2024
Hey Roman here, a quick update on how things are progressing with me.
At the start of my journey i was given a stage 4 diagnosis, & a very grim life expectancy. Life was very difficult, & chemo was very harsh on my body, mind and soul. I battled on & followed the oncologists instructions, until eventually i was told that my treatment had essentially stopped working.
Faced with this realisation, i was forced to make a difficult decision...
I decided to opt out of chemo, & try to take a more natural/holistic approach experimenting with a lot of things but mainly diet. Coming up to my quarterly scan, i was nervous but optimistic to see the outcome. The cancer had shown to only have progressed a miniscule amount, which was a shocking revelation for my type of cancer. With these results i opted to stay off chemo & stick to this way of combating/maintaining this cancers growth.
Fast forward to the present & ive been off chemo for about 8 months. Although things are okay for now the cancer is still progressing at a slow rate, & i know eventually i will need some sort of medical intervention. I am optimistic about the situation, but i am under no delusions & know that i am in for a big fight. Luckily i have a lot of loving, generous, & strong support which continues to keep my spirits high.
A massive thank you to everyone who has shown their love in anyway during this diffucult time. Words can never truly do justice to how much i appreciate everyones support.
Love yous all

This is very overdue, I'm sorry!
On behalf of Roman & his family, we would all like to say a massive THANK YOU to you all for your amazing generosity & support!
He is a few chemo sessions in, with no official change to report as yet. He has had good days, & some not so great days, which is an expected part of this journey. Still he continues to take each day as it comes, with a smile, determined, positive & very grateful for the overwhelming love & support you have all shown.
Thank you all X❤️O

This has been very hard on Cherie and her two children, who haven't known what is in store and each time she gets a check up, she is told things have either slightly improved or not changed at all.
Unfortunately, on her last check up, Cherie was told that the chemotherapy is no longer working and her last treatment option is pemigatinib which is a target medication towards the type of cancer that is causing her trouble (bile duct). As the cost is $7,272.50 per three weeks and not publicly funded, her oncologist lodged a special request through pharmac which was declined. This broke Cherie's heart as she simply can't afford the ongoing costs of treatment.
The constant health issues that come with chemotherapy are leaving Cherie exhausted and causing great pain for her family who are struggling to see her so unwell.
If you can help Cherie start this treatment - ($126,468.775 for a full year), her family - and particularly her two children, would get their lives back. Anything helps! Give this family the hope to spend a healthy Christmas together next year and a future that is positive and life giving!

Today I got an interesting email asking me to attend a hearing for the petition we sent to government for funding for pharmac. The hearing will last for 10 minutes and I need to say why it would be beneficial to pay for this drug.
I will keep you posted on how it goes, hopefully it means future patients with this type of cancer can get the treatment for free.
Meanwhile, Cherie is still raising money for her children's future and funeral costs. A few thousand has been deposited into her account and any future money will just go straight into her account.

Our goal has decreased but we still need help!
23 April 2024
Thanks to Cherie's oncologist, Pharmac has agreed to start paying for her drug after 13 rounds... Cherie has just started her 5th round so she still has seven rounds before it will be paid for. Which means, we need another $51,000 instead of the huge amount we had before - that's half of what we were originally aiming for. We are also awaiting a reply about the petition we sent through. If that goes through, she will hopefully not have to pay, but for now, we have the goal of seven rounds! Please help with anything you can afford, or failing that, please share this! thank you.

Money run out
4 April 2024
Hi Guys! So the money has run out and Cherie is now on to her fourth round (which we managed to pay for by cobbling together resources) - which means we have three weeks to fundraise for the next round of meds which is another $7272.50. If you can help out in any way - please do. Also, some great news - Mark Cameron MP is bringing the petition to parliament this week at the next sitting date. We are asking the government to approve the cancer drug like it has been overseas so that pharmac can pay for it. Please pray for this as it would be lovely for us not to have to be frantically trying to find the money each three weeks.

Three treatments down - a positive and a negative!
25 March 2024
Cherie has just about completed three treatments rounds now, but still needs another few rounds before she has an idea of what the future entails. We are currently petitioning to the government to get it covered for free but at the moment it is still 7272.50 per each three week round. If you can donate towards her next round that would help a lot. She is noticing her cancer markers are coming down and will be getting a scan soon to see how much of a difference its made. We will update you then!

Please keep sharing! and donating (if you can) On to round three!
24 February 2024
We have currently raised almost enough for those three weeks and the news is good! Her tumour markers have dropped from 3500 to 1950! Which means the treatment is working as it should.
Cherie is well on to her second round of three weeks of treatment (at a whopping $7272.50 every three weeks for 14 precious pills! ($520 per pill). Cherie starts her third round in early March.
We would like to carry on part these three weeks, so if you can PLEASE keep sharing this page and donate anything you can.
We have also sent through a petition to the government for Pharmac to pay for the medication. Currently the government says that as it is an experimental drug, until the drug is approved, it can't be paid for - even though it has been approved in America and other countries.
Please keep sharing and pray for a positive decision from Pharmac.
Thanks so much for all your prayers, support and donations! It's helped Cherie so much!!

Big jump in costs
7 February 2024
Sorry guys but we just realised that it wasn't $7,272.50 per month, but actually per every three weeks - which is astronomical. This means it's actually $126,468.775 for a whole year. We only just realised it wasn't being dispensed monthly. So we have raised enough for nine weeks, almost, rather than three months. At the moment, Cherie is just about to start her fourth week. Which means please don't forget to sign that petition! and keep sharing if you can! https://petitions.parliament.nz/f8c64670-e46a-48c2-a963-08dc186b8b6e

ALMOST THREE MONTHS!!!
6 February 2024
We are just about to pay for Cherie's second prescription for her second month and the GST on the pills makes it an odd amount of $7272.50, which is why we have slightly changed the goal but GREAT News, we are almost up to THREE MONTHS in donations!!! $21,817.50 is about how much it will cost to pay for three months and we are almost there! By three months Cherie will be able to know how her bloods are going and whether the medication is working. For now, she is feeling a lot better now she is no longer on chemotherapy and we are all sending out positive vibes that these pills make her feel even better. You prayers, shares and donations are so appreciated and Cherie has been reading all the beautiful messages. Thanks so much for the help everyone!

I have been diagnosed with multiple chronic illnesses including; Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), Functional Neurological disorder (FND),hypermoblile elhers danlos syndrome (hEDS), and Abdominal Vascular Compression Syndromes (AVCS). This has been a 7-year journey with doctors unable to diagnose my condition until now. This has resulted in many failed treatments, testing, and medications that have provided little to no relief.
Due to the AVC's, I have lost my ability to eat among other symptoms which has caused me to decline to the point where I have lost weight and now live malnourished and dehydrated due to lack of nutrition whilst relying upon my feeding tube.
Treatment for AVC is NOT available in New Zealand. My vascular surgeon has recommended multiple specialists in Germany who work together to perform life-saving surgery to release these compressions which would give me back my quality of life back.
Hypermobility (potential heds) has an impact on all the connective tissue in your body, affecting joints, tissue fragility, and hypermobility. This is what has caused me to suffer from AVC's, causing tummy pain, vomiting, and nausea among many other symptoms leaving me unable to eat or drink.
I want my full life back but more importantly, I want a life at all.
Any donation will bring me one step closer to getting to live my 'normal teenage' life, thank you!

On the 29th of March I turned 6 months & I cannot even describe how incredible it was celebrate the way I did. I went to Easter Camp, on the anniversary of my surgery I went to adrenaline forest. A confidence course, harnessed in 25m above ground walking over obstacles and zip lining. I only lasted less than an hour but it an incredible celebration of my life 2.0. Even though I was plagued with nausea, vomiting, pain & so many other symptoms over the weekend this would have been IMPOSSIBLE 6 months ago in fact it would have been impossible 2 weeks ago pre picc line. I was able to get adequate hydration and decent nutrition over the weekend which meant that I could go even though I spent so much time sleeping. The best part of it all was that I was able to celebrate 6 months with Taylor!This was a full circle moment from finding out about AVCS, to staying with her family over summer and being soooo unwell to going to a camp with her. While I am still SOOOO unwell & by no means 100% better, I am well and truly 100% better than I was 6 months ago and even 2 weeks ago.
Medical devices while they have some huge issues are all steps towards life while we wait hoping my stomach will recover and my body will start to function better. we also know that if this is as good as it gets once I’ve got surgical tube options surgery will still be 100% worth it.
Life is so worth fighting for & their hope + joy right around the corner of even some of the most hopeless feeling situations.

Feeding tube awareness 2024
11 February 2024
Why do I still have a feeding tube ?
This question has been the part of discussions around surgery that make it seem like a failure when it really is the opposite. Before surgery any feeding tube NGT or NJT we tried was excruciating, made me vomit terribly and left me with lip quivering, sobbing nausea. Feed was literally travelling back from my intestines in my stomach the wrong way?!
So seeing me with a working tube now is actually a sign of huge success. Because to have a tube that works with no pain in the same way, less nausea, only vomiting due to other conditions I’d say is a pretty big win.
Whilst I say all of this my feeding tube experiences have been pretty awful at times. I had my first ever tube placed in 2020 so 4 years ago for my bowel initially, since then I’ve had over 3,000 pieces of tube shoved down my nose (throwing up, up 6 times a day on an NGT every single day for over a year!), THIS year alone I’ve placed my own feeding tube 179 times! My nostrils are inflamed, swollen, bleed & can hardly handle a tube anymore yet I am dependant on this little plastic tube for my survival. We are hopeful for a better solution soon !
But here’s to feeding tube awareness week 2024. Thank you to the tubes that have saved my life & continue to sustain my life, you’ve truly taken me from my worst to a place of semi stability.

Wonderful awareness piece on feeding tubes , good to highlight how uncomfortable they are normally, let alone when there are problems placing them. You are a fighter Olivia - keep fighting and you’ll get there . Any and all progress is a step in the right direction :)
Update on changes to page
7 January 2024
This is a formal update to let everyone know where we are at with the funds we've raised and the extension of this page.
We have lowed the amount we are raising to 100,000 due to private donations we've gotten making the other 40,000.
We are extending this page further as we have not raised all the funds to cover the Germany trip and I will have further ongoing costs in New Zealand.

Update from home!
5 December 2023
Being home has quite honestly been one of the best but hardest things I’ve ever done.
I was removed from my reality, the medical system and life for over 2 months while I was away and truly that was a blessing.
Coming home to the friends, family and a new kitten make it ohh so worth it but coming home to very broken medical system that still doesn’t believe or support me has been incredibly difficult.
Coming home knowing I am still VERY sick has made it bittersweet.
Since getting home I’ve started a few new medications for my nausea, POTS and bornavirus. In terms of my gastrointestinal issues this is a waiting game, giving surgery some more time to continue to help, letting my bornavirus be treated and then taking it step by step with the gastropareis.
My NG tube is giving me the ability to as you can see spend time with some very precious people that I am so lucky to be able to call my friends, go back to church and attend events I never thought possible.
Life is still very hard with lots of ups and downs, but it’s a life I am grateful I get to have at all. I’ve got an article with NZ Herald coming out soon and one with Women’s Weekly in January.

Good on you Olivia. Nice to see you looking so well. Have a great Christmas!
Update !
30 November 2023
I am so so sorry for not updating this page! We have gotten caught up in the recovery and life in general in Germany and now back in New Zealand.
Whilst in Germany we made sure to do a little bit of adventuring to help with my walking and recovery generally! We headed to Amsterdam for the day and also went back to Leipzig for more scans.
My post op scans showed that all the compressions were decompressed, my kidney had stayed pinned and so much had improved!
What remains is likely due to Gastroparesis, bornavirus, POTS, CRPS and of course EDS.
Despite things not being perfect and my stomach still not working properly at all due to other conditions I now have a hope and a life !
We have started a 3 month treatment for Bornavirus, some new POTS meds and other medications to try and manage symptoms.
Being home has been amazing but hard. Amazing to see everyone and be getting back to life but hard to face those medical professionals that nearly let me die.
Eating and drinking with and around others in my own small, different way is incredibly important and Meaningful to me!
I will endeavour to do better at keeping you all up to date :)

Just great to know you're doing well. I was alerted yesterday to the Facebook page - Olivia's Broken Stomach (nothing like stating the facts!) and it was good to see photos of you doing so much better. Will keep praying for you that things continue to improve.

Big hugs and strength to you Olivia, as you start your new treatments and face all your appointments back home xoxo Go easy on yourself (no apologies required in this space!), and enjoy eating and drinking with your loved ones. Merry Christmas xx
Post op checks
20 October 2023
On Friday 13th I was discharged from Clinic Bel Etage after 14 days. On Monday I had post discharge blood work, ultrasound and Professor Sandmann took me out for ice cream. I have the upmost respect for Professor Sandmann for saving my life and doing so in such a humble manner. He truly is a life saver and one of a kind human being with the sweetest soul.
Due to my infection from last week my feeding tube has had to be replaced so I got a few tube free few hours during ice cream without but it is now back in again to give me adequate nutritional support.

Hi Olivia, I note you mention scans -- people just say this in passing and it does not mean much to them if they have not had for example a CAT Scan, which can take an Hour or so -- with often a disclosure fluid injection through a line into your arm vein so they can better see the stomach
organs such as the kidneys, etc. It is not a 5 minute job. Ulta Sound is a lot easier.
That smile on your face eating an Ice Cream --made my day !!! ( 10th October )
11 days post op ( 10th October)
20 October 2023
Sorry we’ve taken SO long to give an update it has just been such a roller coaster ride. I was doing really well and then I got an infection, it has taken a few days to recover from that and is now under control. Yesterday my epidural and catheter were removed and I now only have a central line for feed and antibiotics. Other pain medication I’m taking orally (you read it right orally, I can drink and take pills without pain and vomiting). I have now managed very small portions of food.
I also went to the mall today! We escaped and I managed to walk part of the way myself. Discharge is looking like Friday with stitches out on Thursday. I still have a lot of pain and vomiting as a result of the pain with heavy pain medication but I have a life again!
Thank you for the out pouring of support we have had, you’ve all truly changed/saved my life!

The staff were amazing ! We got a row of 3 to ourselves despite it being a super full flight. We were also allowed 5 (overweight) carry on bags full of our medication, nj feeds, tubing sets and other medical equipment. As long as you are kind, have the correct documentation and allow plenty of extra time you’ll be fine with the accomodations you need ❤️
We are flying to Dubai at 9pm tonight and then from Dubai to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Leipzig arriving at 6pm on the 26th German time or 5am 27th New Zealand time.

Dates for Germany!

Hi everyone!
We wanted to say a HUGE thank you for the outpouring of support that we have received!
We now have dates for our scans and surgery in Germany - we will fly to Germany on the 24th of September for scans on the 28th and then surgery is booked for the 3rd of October.
Currently, we are still battling for any support around nutrition and hydration while we wait for Germany which is proving extremely unsuccessful.
Thank you for you love, prayers and support it really does mean the world to us as a family ❤️

She’s been keeping people safe in the mountains for her entire career. She’s a strong woman & is fighting hard to be there for her children for a long time yet. Roo is full of hope & positivity & she’s not giving up.
Recently her cancer (which had receded to a few tiny lymph nodes) has started growing again. Roo was getting funded chemo alongside Avastin (see our previous page here: https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/roo) but she has now become resistant to the chemo and can no longer continue with Avastin

Nic is 42 years old, with 3 young girls. They are 12, 8, and 4 years old. This has come as a huge shock, as she had very few symptoms.

Thank you so much to each and every person who has continued to donate to the page to help the Petrie Family, they are so appreciative of how willing people are to help them through Nic’s treatment.
On Monday, Nic had spoken about getting family photos, prior to her treatment. I offered to organise someone, and we also talked about getting her hair and makeup done, as a treat.
A few years ago, I had seen photos from a wedding, I thought were amazing, so with this in mind I sent an email to Sinead of Sinead McGirven Photography, asking if she had any time available before the 20th May.
At the same time, I reached out to Koren of KP Bridal Hair. I had seen photos, of how talented she was too!
I was amazed when they both messaged back, saying they would love to help Nic, and neither of these lovely humans expected payment. I was blown away. Koren, and Sinead didn’t know Nic but, both were willing to go out of their way to help her.
A big thank you too, to Kirsten at Amplified Costemica, who booked Nic and her mum in straight away, even though Kirsten had staff away, and was starting her Maternity Leave. She was amazing, and offered a space for Koren to work also.
A big shout out for today to Koren, Kirsten and Sinead for being such generous, kind humans.
Thank you.

An update from Nic and Nicky x
14 May 2024
Hi 👋
We just wanted ti give you an update on Nic.
Last week, Nic attended an appointment with an Oncologist at Mercy Hospital.
From there she has been given an option to receive treatment moving forward. The treatment will begin on the 21st May.
A message from Nic follows:
“I am on a combination of drugs called, Folfoxiri - Modified drugs, for 8-16 weeks, they are funded, and then I have an opportunity to take an unfunded BRAF specific drug, called Ceiteximab Encrorafenib.
This will cost approximately $10-$15k per month, with an estimate of $60-$70k in total. It is not funded in NZ at all.
This specific drug is to target my aggressive tumour, and will hopefully extend my life. As the BRAF mutation only occurs in 15% of bowel cancers - the Give A Little page will give me a fighting chance”.
A massive thank you to you all, for continuing to support Nic, and her family. It is so appreciated.
Thank you,
Nic Petrie and Nicky Clouston

As well as looking after her own whānau, Kylie also looks after so many of the students she teaches - going above and beyond for everybody she encounters. Now it’s our turn to look after her.
Kylie has recently been diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive form of breast cancer, which has spread to her lymph nodes. Not all treatment for TNBC is currently funded, unlike other forms of breast cancer. Kylie and her family are yet again facing another long fight ahead of them. Her son was almost killed two years ago when the car he was travelling in was struck by a drunk-driver, severely injuring him, his friend and sadly killing his friend’s grandmother who was driving. Kylie’s family have faced more hardship and trauma than any family should have to endure and it is unthinkable that they are now facing the loss of this incredible woman.
The treatment that will give Kylie the best chance of survival is not funded and will cost approximately $70,000. Additionally, Kylie has no sick leave available to her as she used it all caring for her son during his recovery. We are asking for any donations you can manage in order to support Kylie and her family to fight this battle.

Funds for Maggie to buy more time with her children,Maggie Ngatai needs help funding a new wonder drug cancer treatment which can buy her more years with her young daughters.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/23dab1f0-401b-476b-b3a1-b1600109026c-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/funds-for-maggie-to-buy-more-time,74297.5,175000.0,116 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/funds-for-maggie-to-buy-more-time,28 Apr 2024,28 Oct 2024,0,Auckland,441,"Everyone who knows Maggie loves her sweet spirit, caring and generous nature, and natural positivity. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, the day before her daughter's fourth birthday. A dedicated mother of two girls, she set about immediate treatment with chemo, surgery and radiation, and after 12 months of treatment went into remission. A year later the cancer returned in her neck and has now spread to lesions in her brain, which have caused seizures and affected her mobility - though luckily her thinking and speech is not affected. Maggie can no longer manage moving around her house so she is now living with her mum who can provide full-time care. Oncologists have recommended a new wonder drug combination known as TDXD (Trastuzumab deruxtecan), which is currently unfunded and very expensive - but is seen as the best option for stopping the spread of the disease and giving quality of life.
The family has used up their savings and are looking at remortgaging a house to help fund treatment. There is hope that the government may fund half the drug, but even so, Maggie and her whaanau are looking at costs of at least $175,000 for the first year of treatment ($3,330 per week).
Maggie's two young daughters are now aged 7 and 11. Every extra day with them is precious and she remains focused on being the best parent she can be. Maggie is usually the first to help others, but now she needs our help to give her extra time with her girls. Any donation will be much appreciated.

Maggie has begun the TD-XD treatment! Her first chemotherapy infusion went smoothly and her second session begins next week. She is doing well, although fatigue has hit hard.
Funding for cancer treatment has been in the news a lot, although so far it doesn’t look like TD-XD is included. The media have reached out to Maggie again, and she spoke this week in support of the Breast Cancer Foundation’s call for funding of critical breast cancer treatments, which are so needed.
See:
https://fb.watch/sWjikDL16s/?
and:
https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/breast-cancer-patient-paying-175k-for-treatment-hopeful-that-new-pharmac-boost-will-cover-her-medicine/YLHWLXRAHVEMTMGAPSH6UA3NQU/
The announcement of a major funding boost to Pharmac is truly wonderful news for many cancer sufferers. We are thrilled for all the people who will benefit. 💜Apparently the funding increase will cover 26 cancer treatments, including some for breast cancer. However, the need for more treatment options is clear so we hope TD-XD may be added to the list of funded treatments soon. 🤞🤞
In the meantime Maggie needs to continue her treatment with TD-XD, and for now this still means having to pay for the drug and for private treatment. So we give sincere and humble thanks to all of you – your contributions enable this treatment to happen. Every message, prayer and koha means a lot and is truly appreciated. ❤️ At this time of Matariki, hold your family close x

Some good news ✨✨✨
19 June 2024
Posted by: Jessica Ngatai
Kia ora tātou,
We have two great pieces of news since our last update:
The first is that newshub featured Maggie in a story about the importance of funding cancer treatments such as TD-XD. You can see the story here: https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2024/06/auckland-mum-with-advanced-breast-cancer-fights-for-new-wonder-drug.html
Maggie wanted to do this story so that all the other women in her position will have their need publicised, and to stress that access to world-class treatment should be equitably available to all, not just those who can afford it. (In this news story, Maggie looks different to how you may remember her – which is due to the steroids she's on.)
The second great piece of news is that Maggie started her first treatment on TD-XD last week! It was a very long day, but all went smoothly.
It's such exciting news, and you all have helped make this possible. It's the best chance Maggie has, so thank you and aroha nui from the bottom of our hearts.

To all Maggie’s friends, whānau and supporters, our sincere and humble thanks for your response since this page went live.
Maggie – and all the whānau – have been overwhelmed by your awhi, love and generosity.
You are amazing and we truly appreciate all the messages of love and encouragement, and the generous support that people have given.
For Maggie, the last few weeks have been the usual busy schedule of appointments, visitors, treatments, physio, chemo cycles, doctor visits … etc, as well a busy back to school for the girls. Mother’s Day was a highlight (including some beautiful artwork and treats).
Maggie is due to start the new treatment (Td-xd) as soon as possible (hopefully in the next couple of weeks). Your kindness and generosity is helping to make this possible and is so appreciated.

Always there to help others with his kindness, understanding & generosity.
Shane was recently diagnosed with Bowel Cancer & underwent surgery late last year to remove a large section of lower intestine. The specialists thought the surgery had cured the cancer. However a routine MRI three months post surgery revealed the Bowel Cancer had spread through his blood to his liver. Devastatingly diagnosed with Stage 4 Bowel Cancer with metastases in his liver, odds of survival are 1 in 3. Shane has urgently started Chemotherapy treatment. This will be ongoing for the next three months, followed by surgery to remove three quarters of his liver & then more Chemotherapy. The specialists want Shane to receive additional treatment which will improve his chances of survival. However these additional medications are not funded by the government & at this stage the cost is upwards of $50,000.
He will be making frequent trips to Wellington, Hastings & Auckland to see specialists & receive treatment. This also necessitates him taking time off work to make this happen.
Shane has an amazing partner Sam & they have two gorgeous kids Rufus (3) & Cameron (1). Sam, Rufus & Cam mean the absolute world to Shane & he wants to spend as much time as possible with his family.
It's time for us all to extend the same kindness to Shane & Sam that they so readily extend to others. Please give generously if you are able. Every bit truly helps.

My name is Maddi Wilson, I’m 9 years old and live in Tauranga!
This letter is an introduction into who I am.
Ever since I was born I have struggled to stay healthy and always seem to be going to hospital for treatment and on-going investigations so the doctors and nurses can work out what I have, and how to manage it long term.
What we know is that I have “Chronic Suppurative Lung Disease”, along with Asthma, and we think “Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia” but are waiting on further diagnosis to confirm this.
All of this means I get sick really easily (like every week) and when I do, it affects me more than most other kids.
I'm having to get IV antibiotics almost constantly through my portacath, but since I started using a “shared” machine from the hospital called a “Cough Assist” it helps me clear the “gunk” out of my lungs, meaning the bacteria and virus don’t get a chance to overwhelm me so much.
This machine has been a game changer. Since using it I haven't needed as much IV antibiotics and barely any hospital treatment to control the pneumonia and chest infections!
Only problem is that the machine is lent out to several others too, and if my illness flares up while it is away with someone else, I end up back in hospital where i am now.
Mum and Dad (Victoria & Danniel) are trying to raise the $20,000 we need to buy one of these machines but they need help, and that’s where we hope you may be able to help us.

She remains in a critical condition in ICU. What we know is she has an enlarged left side of her heart which caused her to go into ventricular fibrillation which led to the cardiac arrest. She has suffered a hypoxic brain injury as a result of the cardiac arrest.
Waiting for her at home is her gorgeous baby boy and partner.
This is an awful, unbelievably painful and uncertain time for her, her family and all her nearest and dearest.
Raising money will allow Pheobe and her family the time they need to get through the long journey ahead without the financial burden.

21 May 2024
Pheobe has made great progress towards eating, talking & walking. Although she has a long, arduous journey ahead she continues to impress with her determination, will power & stubbornness to get home to her family. One major factor that hugely benefits in her recovery is her age and health prior to this traumatic event. We are feeling very hopeful and positive for her.
We appreciate the support we continue to receive & to see how many lives Pheobe has touched over the years. She truely does have a way of connecting to each person on a personal level, making them feel special & valued.
We understand everyone is waiting with bated breath for updates, for her to come home & wanting to see her however there are no answers to give with certainty at this time. This is a hugely time dependent situation with more investigations needing to be done over the foreseeable future.
Right now our main focus & priority is getting our girl home safe & sound to her family. There are plans in place for the immediate future for her recovery, it will be some time before she returns home. With that being said, it is in Pheobe’s best interests for her privacy & recovery that no additional visitors are allowed to see her currently. We understand that this is a difficult time for all but this is what’s best for Pheobe. There will be time in the distant future for visitors. Pheobe’s health, wellbeing & supporting her recovery is priority.

Pheobe’s progress / a message of thanks
10 May 2024
A little update on Pheobe.
Pheobe is now in a stable condition and has made some really positive progress. She no longer requires the level of care ICU offers which is fantastic news. She has been moved to the ward where she will continue to receive the treatment she needs. She has a team of medical professionals helping her with her long journey ahead. We are feeling positive for the future. Our Pheobe/ Gen is a fighter!
We would like to extend our sincerest gratitude to all of the very generous donations received since the opening of this page. We are overwhelmed and blown away by the generosity and support we have received. Thank you so, so much, words cannot express how appreciative and grateful we are. This undoubtedly relieves Pheobe and her family of the financial pressure and allows us to solely focus on Pheobe and her recovery. Thank you!

Sadly, this cancer of the bone marrow is currently incurable, and he has the most aggressive form. Initially he was treated with a triple drug regime partially funded by Pharmac, and achieved an amazing 3 years of remission, but the myeloma returned in November 2023.
A bit about Dad: He set up practice at the Waitangirua Health Centre in the mid 70's. His experiences at Harlem Hospital as a final year student had made him determined to help those most disadvantaged by gaps in health systems.
He worked tirelessly as a family GP for 43 years, caring for thousands of patients, and delivering over 1000 babies before the midwives took over in 1990.
He's most well-known for his work mentoring family doctors in the Postgraduate GP Training Scheme, several of whom have settled locally. He was awarded a Queens Service Medal in 2013 for this work.
Sadly, after decades of helping other people through the gaps in the public health system, Dad's treatment is now in one of those gaps.
His health insurance policy doesn't cover his treatment, and it's 400k, which means making difficult choices between extending his life and providing for mum - who has recently been diagnosed with Parkinsons. Any amount you give will make a difference, however it's tough financial times out there! If you cannot afford it, a comment will provide him with many riches to help him with his journey.
Many thanks.

A heartfelt thankyou to you all
9 February 2024
Posted by: Logan McLennan
I am humbled and simultaneously up-lifted by all the donations and comments which have been made and my thanks to you all is heart-felt. The expensive treatment I have started is aimed at achieving a deeper and longer remission and is at the frontier of treatment. Myeloma is cancer of plasma cells hidden inside the bone marrow and so it harder for drugs to get to the rogue cells. For those New Zealanders who have no chance of paying for them, they are left with no option but to be treated with older drugs funded by Pharmac which can induce partial remissions which usually do not last very long. The donations you have made to Give-A-Little will go a long way to help me achieve a deeper and longer remission and I am very grateful to you all. The comments that you have made have been very uplifting and have raised my spirits greatly. I thank you all.

You were so kind & patient & a brilliant doctor it make me sad to hear you have this bone marrow disease. I know their are many people like myself who wish you well & a speedy recovery when the money raised for your treatment does help you. So sad to hear about your wife as well. Your two amazing children are your strength to see you both get the help you both truly need. It's sad to read this but I know you both are strong & will stay that way for a positive outcome. All the best from me & my four children.

Your donation today will literally help save her life.
In November 2023, Amanda was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of breast cancer that doesn’t respond as well to conventional treatment. Since then she has undergone five months of chemotherapy, a total mastectomy and reconstruction, and will soon face radiation and further chemotherapy. Her treatment thus far has not managed to eradicate her cancer. She would like to pursue immunotherapy treatment (Keytruda), a drug that has been shown to reduce the chance of recurrence of this type of cancer in clinical trials. However, the cost of this treatment is roughly $100,000 and is not funded for her stage of cancer (3C). Amanda and her partner Brendon are not able to afford this cost. Amanda is a 36 year old mum of two young girls (ages 2 and 6), an athlete, a kickass employee for Hatch, and a loyal friend, daughter, auntie and sister.
Please give generously to help save her life by providing a proven effective treatment for her type of breast cancer. We cannot thank you enough for caring.

This type of cancer is incurable, and all we wish for is more time to create lasting memories with our cherished 33-year-old family member and friend.
With limited treatment options due to the cancer's recurrence and previous treatments, chemotherapy is now the primary choice. While chemo may slow or halt the cancer's progression, our hope is for a potential reversal.
Although immunotherapy paired with chemotherapy could offer promising results, immunotherapy is not funded for Ariana as she doesn’t reach funding guidelines, resulting in a monthly cost of $10,000 NZD. We are determined to provide Ariana with the necessary treatments and are actively seeking funding support to prolong her time with us.
Ariana's cancer journey began in August 2019, leading to intensive treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation. Despite facing challenges such as adverse reactions to chemo, Ariana remained strong and resilient, ultimately being declared cancer-free in March 2020.
Unfortunately, in late 2023, Ariana experienced a recurrence of cancer, leading to severe symptoms and the need for a permanent catheter.
To extend the time we have we are aiming to fund immunotherapy at $10,000 per month.
Her animals have helped her through some really dark days and we want to give her some more time to continue enjoying them with her partner Steve and her family and friends

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

But together, we're determined to help him win this battle. His oncologist has recommended a powerful treatment plan, a combination of Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy, which has had remarkable results for some patients.
However, the hurdle we face is that Keytruda, the life-saving immunotherapy, is not covered by Pharmac's funding in New Zealand for stomach cancer. As a result, Duane and his family are facing a $126k bill.
His battle with cancer is relentless, and as surgery is not an option, this makes Keytruda his beacon of hope, despite its proven global effectiveness, this drug remains largely unfunded in New Zealand.
So, we are reaching out to our incredible community for support to help fund Duane's treatment, every bit helps towards the cost of Keytruda and gives Duane a fighting chance to regain a healthy, active life.
Whether you choose to contribute financially or offer moral support, please know that we are immensely grateful. Together, we can help Duane push toward remission by unleashing his immune system's power against this cancer.
Duane's journey may be long and tough, but he faces it with strength and positivity. The Read Family deeply appreciates any contributions toward this lifesaving drug as Duane faces the biggest battle of his life.
With gratitude, The Read Family.

22 May 2024
Posted by: Duane Read
Its been a while since we posted an update so thought it is timely now that Duane has had his first CT Scan since finishing Chemo mid February. We met with Duane's Oncologist yesterday to go over the results and I am pleased to advise that the scan was positive and there has been no further spread to any other organs. One of the tumor's has actually shrunk by 3mm which is great result. Duane's oncologist is very happy with the result and considers the cancer to be ""Stable"" for now meaning there is no need for any further chemotherapy at this stage. So its keep calm and carry on for now, Duane will remain on Keytruda every three weeks and will be scanned again in three months providing nothing changes before then.
Once again thank you all for the support. It really means a lot to us.

12 Rounds of Chemo Done & Dusted
14 February 2024
Posted by: Duane Read
We've reached our goal - 12 rounds of chemo completed! Duane's resilience and positivity throughout this journey have been nothing short of inspiring, facing each phase with courage and a contagious smile.
Today almost threw us a curveball with Duane's white blood cell count being low, but a blood test revealed it's on the rise, prompting his oncologist to give the green light for the final treatment.
Now, it's time to kick back, let his body and the chemo do the work.
The next checkpoint: a CT scan to gauge our position and plan the next steps. That's just a week away, and we'll keep you posted once we have the results.
While it's a farewell to the routine of regular chemo every 2 weeks, Duane will continue with Keytruda every three weeks. So, it's not goodbye to our incredible friends at Harbour Cancer.

Round 11 chemo with Azza
1 February 2024
Posted by: Duane Read
Well we are getting close to the end of chemotherapy. It has been quite the journey but very much looking forward to completing treatment in a fortnight. The side effects are minimal now and Duane is feeling better than ever and will be returning to work in march. Duane was joined by his good friend Aaron Hollows AKA “Azza” for round 11, It was a relatively quick infusion as Duanes oncologist Amanda has dropped the oxaliplatin for now due to neuropathy in his fingers. Azza has been a very close friend of Duane since high school days and was the other half of the radio show they held on friday nights on George FM called “the Midnight snack”
Azza still enjoys spinning tunes at various events. One of the best DJs in Auckland you can catch Azza at Ink bar and Black Wax with good friends Andy Vann and Greg Churchill. We just want to thank everyone for the support we have received. The phone calls, messsges, visitors and support during treatment has been amazing and a bit overwhelming at times. Also a massive shout out to all the extremely generous donations we have received. Thank you all so much. It really has made the journey so much easier to deal with. We will pop the bubbles in a couple of weeks to toast the end of chemo for now.

Duane Hits Chemo Double Digits 🙌
17 January 2024
Posted by: Duane Read
Round 10 of chemotherapy and round 7 of Keytruda, whoop 🙌 Duane had one of his longest and dearest friends, Sarah Murray, by his side for chemo and Keytruda this week. Sarah has been a huge supporter since his diagnosis, and their friendship dates back to the early '90s. They did their OE to London and Europe together, along with Steve Cox when they were all 20 years old. It was an amazing experience, although Duane ran out of money and had a bit of homesickness, so he came home early.
Amanda (Duane's oncologist) is extremely pleased with the progress so far. Her words yesterday were, 'You couldn’t be doing any better,' although she has dropped the Oxaliplatin due to Peripheral Neuropathy (numbness and tingling in the tips of fingers). Oxaliplatin is brutal on the body with a lot of side effects, so Duane is very happy to have this dropped. Two more rounds of chemo, and that is it for Duane. Fingers crossed the Keytruda does its job and keeps the cancer from spreading.

Strength in Family: Round 8 for Duane with his Mum by his side 💕
14 December 2023
Posted by: Duane Read
Round eight of chemo is done and dusted, and Duane had the wonderful company of his mum, Laonie. For those that don’t know; Duanes Mum has battled breast cancer twice and had chemotherapy in 1992 and again in 2010. Laonie really understands exactly what Duane is going through and has been fully clear of cancer for many years now. Duane takes inspiration from his mum to beat his cancer.
The support from Duanes's mum has been nothing short of amazing – touching base most days and popping over with fresh fruit or for a cuppa and a chat.
Duane's oncologist is extremely happy with the progress so far. He has one more treatment scheduled on 27 December, followed by three more in the New Year. After completing round 12, Duane will bid farewell to chemo and continue with Keytruda every three weeks.
In addition to the medical journey, we have been so fortunate and are so appreciative to have such an incredible support network surrounding us. A huge thank you to Timeout (www.timeoutnz.org) for providing an unforgettable getaway in the Bay of Islands a couple of weeks ago. We are extremely gratefull to have been gifted an amazing holiday home to enjoy for 3 nights. The property was stunning and located in a private bay. Thank you Kip and Lynn for your generosity.

Strength in Friendship & Celebrating Progress: Duane's 7th Chemo and 5th Keytruda
30 November 2023
Posted by: Duane Read
We've hit the back half of the treatment journey, with Duane completing Round seven of chemotherapy and Round five of Keytruda. One of Duane's oldest mates, Stefan McCord, stood by his side during this round. With a friendship spanning over 30 years, they've shared flats and supported each other through thick and thin.
Duane underwent a CT scan last Friday as a halfway check, and received the results on Tuesday. His oncologist, Amanda, was extremely happy with Duane's response to the treatment. All tumors in the lymph nodes have decreased. While the primary stomach cancer is challenging to assess accurately, it is still present, but all other organs are clear of cancer. There has been no further spread! Amanda, Duane's oncologist, has said this is an exceptionally positive response to the treatment.
On a different note, a special mention goes out to the Mairangi Bay Fishing Club for their fundraiser on Saturday at the Mairangi Bay Classic Fishing Comp. There was an amazing turnout and a huge number of families at the weigh-in which was great to see. The raffles, sausage sizzle, and a live auction collectively raised $1000. A massive thanks to Wendy, Mark, Matt, and Shaun for organising this fantastic event, and gratitude to everyone who contributed.

Halfway Milestone 🙌
16 November 2023
Posted by: Duane Read
Round 6 of chemo is officially done and dusted. This marks the halfway milestone, and Duane had the company of his good mate and top builder, Grant Morris. Grant, a staunch supporter since the beginning, insisted on setting up the Givealittle page with his lovely wife, Michele. Not only that, but Grant played a significant role in organising the quiz fundraiser held at The Merchant Pub on Sunday evening, which turned out to be a tremendous success.
With 160 attendees showing up to support Duane, the event featured an amazing array of silent auction and raffle prizes, complemented by three live auctions. A massive thank you is due to Lance and Lara for hosting the event, which raised an impressive $30k. This sum will contribute to covering the costs associated with Keytruda immunotherapy.
Special appreciation goes out to all the sponsors who generously donated these fantastic prizes. The overwhelming support received allows us to confirm that we've raised enough to cover the expenses linked to Keytruda.
Now, a few quiet days lay ahead for Duane to recover from chemo, with a CT scan scheduled for the 28th. We're eagerly anticipating the results to see how the treatment is working.
There are photos on Duane’s Facebook of the quiz fundraiser, great memories created from an amazing event.

Round 5 with Cam Gee
2 November 2023
Posted by: Duane Read
Another old friend stepped up as Duane’s chemo buddy for round 5. Cam Gee, a great friend for over three decades, offered his support.
Cam's been a legend since day 1 of Duane's cancer journey. He’s been a constant with regular catch-ups and calls, adding a sprinkle of dry humour and a good chat.
Huge thanks to heavyweight legends of the house music scene, Greg Churchill, Azza, Sweetpants, Ange, Ed, and Andrew, who hit the decks at Ink for the Midnight Snack - Beats for Bodge fundraiser. The event was a success, and all door sales will go straight to the Givealittle fund, we're incredibly grateful for their support.
Speaking of Givealittle, we have some exciting news. In addition to the incredible contributions made to Givealittle, we've also received direct debits to our bank account from the Movie Night fundraiser and the Grove Mitre10 Trade Golf Day. This extra $ isn't reflected in the Givealittle total, but we're thrilled to announce that we're almost at our target, all thanks to your amazing support.
We've got 1 more fundraising event coming up which will get us over the line - a Quiz night at the Merchant on November 12. Tickets are selling fast, so if you’re keen, get in touch with Duane for more details.
We'll keep the Givealittle page open for updates, but we don't expect any more contributions because you've already been incredibly generous. Thank you all for your fantastic support!

Round 4 with Steve from Down Under
21 October 2023
Posted by: Duane Read
Plenty to report this week; it's been busy.
First up, Duane's Oncologist appointment went really well. Amanda is happy with Duane's progress; he's largely pain-free with only occasional little niggles. He has halted the weight loss and even put on a couple of kg’s!
A special visitor this week was our good friend Steve, who traveled all the way from Australia to be Duane's chemo buddy. Duane and Steve go way back to their Westlake Boys days, so they have loads of great memories and stories to share. They've known each other for over 30 years. Steve arrived last Saturday, and we had a good time catching up. Then we enjoyed dinner on Sunday with our extended old school crew. Steve joined Duane for his Chemo + Keytruda session on Wednesday. Lots more good times and memories made.
To add to the excitement, on Wednesday night, Andrea's workplace, Two Hundred Doors, organised an incredible movie night fundraiser. Over 140 people attended, including our good friend Steve. It turned out to be a huge success, raising a whopping $5K to support Duane's treatment – truly AMAZING!
We're so thankful to all the generous sponsors who contributed prizes, Angie, Tash, Anna, and Cara who organised this event, and, of course, everyone who joined the night.
This week has been nothing short of remarkable, filled with unwavering support and cherished moments. Stay tuned for more!

Round 3 with Pistol Pete
4 October 2023
Posted by: Duane Read
Round 3 of Chemo is officially done and dusted, marking the approximate midpoint of Duane's 2023 treatment plan. At the end of the year Duane will take a short break and undergo a CT scan to gauge his progress. Then, it's time to gear up for more chemo in the new year.
This is Duane's good builder mate Pete, aka 'Pistol Pete.' Pete has been a rock throughout this journey, ringing up Duane every single day since the start of chemo. Talk about dedication!
Duane's hanging in there, gearing up for the usual nausea, but here's where things take a twist: the chemo brings some unusual side effects, like tingly hands and muscle cramps. The oddest of them all? 'OXALIPLATIN COLD DYSESTHESIAS.' It's a mouthful, but it simply means Duane can't tolerate or eat/drink anything cold for at least four days post-chemo. Even opening the fridge is off-limits, as it can trigger this sensation.
Now, you might be wondering, what does this unusual side effect feel like? Well, it's like experiencing numbness in your throat and a sensation of being unable to breathe, even though you're breathing just fine. It's not the most pleasant sensation, but the good news is that these episodes usually subside within a few moments.
So, here's to rounding off Chemo 3, with Pistol Pete by his side and a few quirky side effects to keep things interesting. We appreciate all the support and love you've shown us on this journey so far!

The Superheroes at Harbour Cancer
30 September 2023
Posted by: Duane Read
Duane had his 2nd Keytruda treatment on Wednesday, September 27th, we fondly refer to this as the superhero 'liquid gold.' Unlike Chemo, Keytruda hardly has any side effects that have bothered Duane. Plus, it's so quick to administer, compared to its perfect partner, Chemo.
Now, let's talk about the real superheroes—the amazing team at Harbour Cancer. Their service and care are out of this world. We really are in the hands of experts who explain everything that is going on along the way.
And then there's Laura, Duane’s amazing Chemo and Keytruda ‘expert’ nurse. She's simply amazing—so much knowledge and a great sense of humor to boot! That sense of humor really comes in handy dealing with Duane's cheeky nature. A HUGE thank you to Laura, Amanda (Duane’s Oncologist) and the whole Harbour Cancer team for making this journey a little brighter! 💕

Chemo 2 Done and Dusted!
28 September 2023
Posted by: Duane Read
On 20th September, good friend Hamish played the role of Duane's chat buddy during Chemo number 2, and since the treatment took a good few hours to complete, they might have solved all of life's mysteries in that time.
The first chemo round was a bit of a roller coaster ride, with nausea making a fashionably late entrance a few days after the treatment and deciding to overstay its welcome. However, Chemo 2 brought some relief and felt like an easier ride on the roller coaster, providing a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel.
The good news is, Duane is feeling surprisingly good after just two treatments! We suspect the Chemo and Keytruda combo are having a serious pep talk with his unwelcome cancer cells. Leading up to treatment he was in a lot of pain, but the incredible news is he has now been able to ditch the pain relief which is truly amazing 🙏 ❤️

The Start of Duane’s Treatment Journey
28 September 2023
Posted by: Duane Read
We thought we would provide a bit of an update on Duane’s treatment plan. Duane started his 3-month course of chemotherapy and immunotherapy (Keytruda) on September 6th. The chemo will be fortnightly, and Keytruda every 3 weeks. If everything is heading in the right direction after the initial treatment, there will be another 3 months of the same, then the chemo will finish, but Keytruda will carry on. The first treatment went well 💕
This is our new normal now, we are keeping positive and strong xx

25 May 2024
Posted by: Brynn Armstrong
Hi everyone, just a quick update on how things have been going for beautiful little Quinn.
We have reached the end of this phase of treatment with her responding to it all as she should, but with quite a few speed bumps along the way. This phase has been very heavy and meant lots of trips to Staship for theatre for lumbar punctures, chemotherapy, and bone marrow aspirations. She has then had chemotherapy administered by the community nurses at home the following three days and by us every night. All of this is in addition to her myriad of ongoing medications.
Unfortunately, theatre has been tough on her, with ongoing issues to do with her airways closing up while under general anaesthetic. We are super grateful for the amazing Starship team who help get her through these but as you can imagine, it takes a massive toll on her and us.
We are currently staying at Starship at the moment, having been here for the past 9 days, after she developed bad fevers and was rushed to ED. Fortunately she's doing well and we are now just waiting for her white blood cells to recover to a point that she has some immune system before we are allowed home again.
Once again, a massive thank you to everyone for all your incredible support. We are so grateful for everyone who has reached out to us, and incredible generosity through the Give a Little page, which has been life saving with both of us currently not at work while Quinn is staying in hospital.
Love you all heaps 🩷 xx

Update from Māmā and Pāpā
29 March 2024
Posted by: Brynn Armstrong
Hey everyone, a quick update on Quinn and her leukaemia journey 💚
We have successfully made it through the first phase of treatment, with the induction phase going to plan and her responding to treatment how she should. It's taken a big toll on her, as we are sure you can imagine, but she has been an absolute trooper and taking it all in her stride incredibly.
We are home from hospital now which has brought its own challenges, with no immune system, limited sleeping or eating, medication and supplement feeding through her nasal gastric tube, emergency hospital trips with overnight stays, and much more.
We are now on to the consolidation phase of treatment, with 2-3 trips to starship weekly, chemotherapy 4 days a week, and theatre once a week for lumbar punctures and intrathecal chemotherapy (into the spinal fluid).
It has taken a heavy toll on us as a family, but we are absolutely overwhelmed by the incredible love and support we have received from everyone. Words can't explain the gratitude we feel for everyone that has had our backs throughout this and helped us get through. For everyone who has contributed to the Give A Little, we are blown away by your generosity and can't thank you enough. We are sorry we aren't able to message everyone individually to say thank you.
We will keep giving updates where we can as things progress and do our best to respond to messages while we juggle work, hospital, and care for our baby girl.

Brave little fighter
28 February 2024
On behalf of Brynn, Jimmy and Quinn we would like to thank you for the immense outpouring of love and support over the past three weeks since their world was turned upside down. It has been an emotional rollercoaster of the unknown and extremely overwhelming for the most part, however they have read every single message of support and love which has helped brighten many cloudy days so far!
Exciting news for our beautiful girl as she has been discharged from Starship hospital and graduated to “outpatient” status, which means she can spend time back in the familiarity of her home with Mum, Dad and Nona. However Quinn’s treatment plan now requires her to travel to Starship Hospital 3-4 times per week for chemotherapy, monitoring and ongoing surgeries. The side effects of treatment are challenging and heartbreaking with next to no energy, constant pain and hair loss setting in yet Quinn’s cheeky personality still shines through most days.
Brynn and Jimmy are learning to navigate this chapter the best they can and are hanging in there, it is an extremely long road ahead requiring full time care and your continued love and support is cherished by all.
🤍

Aayla aged 16 was diagnosed back in 2010 with Brain Tumors in her head. Aayla completed 3 years of aggressive Chemotherapy treatment which was deemed unsuccessful. To this day Aayla's Tumors continue to grown & multiply. Aayla has now lost the feeling in half her head.
Paetyn aged 22 was diagnosed in 2023 with a large aggressive Tumor in his whole right thigh. This Tumor needs to shrink to even attempt any surgical pathway, even then this is not a guaranteed option. Paetyn may lose his leg. Paetyn started Chemotherapy straight away. Sadly this treatment is not funded in New Zealand therfore costing Patrick & Leisha $5000 per treatment for the drug Trametinib
Just last week(end of March 2024) the dreaded news hit the family yet again. Brae aged 15 had an MRI which has shown Tumors & Lesions in his body. This news is so raw & the family are still coming to terms with what they have been told. A treatment plain is currently being arranged.
On top of the above the 4 older children all carry the genetic condition Neurofibromatosis. This gene has been passed on from their dad Patrick who had no idea he had this genetic condition until Leisha was pregnant with child #4. Its a possability Aayla & Brae will both need the same drug Paetyn is on. Adult services transfer is fast approaching which means not funded.

Paetyn is having a wee break from his chemotherapy treatment until after surgery. This is to give his body and tumour removal the best chance in healing and recovery from his major surgery which is booked for this Thursday June 20th at 8am. We are all beyond nervous. Please hold him in your thoughts and send any positive vibes, prayers and energy you can. We are trying to prepare the house for his arrival home and the modifications he may need. Nothing is quite going to plan but that is life. Occupational therapist have dropped off his wheelchair at least. Paetyn is as always a man of little words but seems in ok spirits. This is greatly helped by how supportive his workplace has been. I will forever be greatful to them and how they have positivley supported him in this and his desire to be successful despite all the obstacles and reasons to add to the 'to hard basket'. Thank you to all of you who have supported us and paetyn this far and those who continue to do so.
Unfortunately we don't get completion or end dates. This is a continuous vicious cycle of life and health altercations with the family genetics.

This precious cargo is a month supply of Chemo which you have all helped supply
30 April 2024
Early morning delivery today... another month of chemotherapy...
Thank you everyone who has shared our page, shared our news article, donated and kept us in your thoughts. Treatment and access to this drug would not be possible without all of you. Paetyn is struggling but still pushes a positive mindset. Our oncologist has sent a NIPA request to pharmac which a previous oncologists application was denied. We will continue to do all we can to access this medication. Paetyn will be undergoing a high risk surgery which we need to prepare for as well as continuing chemotherapy treatment.
Thank you again

Keeping you in the loop on the ""Use of Funds""
10 April 2024
Hi everyone, When this page was orginally set up the ""use of funds"" were all going to Paetyn's Chemotherpy Drug Tranitinib, which cost $5000 per month. Sadly Paetyn has had to lower his Chemo drug as his body can not cope with the previous dose. Therefore lowering his dose lowers the cost of this drug. At this stage the approximate cost is $2500 per month. Surgery is in the very near future for Paetyn. With this comes many challenges & needs for the family on how to accommodate Paetyn with the very real risk of the loss of the use of his leg, There has also been another sad outcome within the family as Tumors have now been found in Paetyn's little brother's body, As you can understand the Lockley Family are going through a massive amount of emotional pain & stress. All funds now raised will be used for within the family. There is a more in-depth explanation of expenses that will be updated under the ""use of funds' once processed by the Givealittle Team. Other changes are also the page heading & about info. It made sense to combine the whole Lockley Family Medical Journey into one Givealittle page. Thank you for your support & understanding in the latest changes.

Surgery & continued Chemo for Paetyn
22 February 2024
Unfortunately the tumor has grown about 4mm. The good news is that the rate of growth has slowed down with chemotherapy. The bad news is that the neurosurgeon has told Paetyn that he should proceed with urgent surgery. There is so much to share in an update but very little room(says Paetyn’s mum)
Paetyn’s surgeon has said he is quite concerned as Paetyn’s nerves are not healthy. He is now having to look at having to do a combined process of surgery and chemo...long term Chemo. Chemo is shattering him, physical pain, exhaustion, rashes, unable to sleep among so many other side effects. Surgery comes with a high level of risk. “Best case” is removing most and leaving the sheath to hopefully minimise sacrificing the nerve which would mean loss of function of a leg. “The middle case” is nerve damage needing rehab and possible lifelong nerve damage. “Worst case” complete loss of leg function and no recovery possible.
At 22, these are heavy decisions and acutely affect Paetyn’s dreams & aspirations for his entire life. His life physically and emotionally, his work, his financial survival, his ability to work and pursue his job and climb that ladder. Everything feels so up in the air and heavy for Paetyn & his family. Long term Chemo is not possible without the give a little support, donations or any other fundraising.
Thank you for taking the time to read this update.
Your help & support is truly appreciated.

The latest update on Paetyn’s fight
21 September 2023
Paetyn has had a few unsettling weeks trying to get CK levels down. Unfortunately he is plagued with quite extreme back pain. His Oncologist decided to lower his dose & see if this helps. We've had a talk on quality of life and end goals which is never an easy conversation to have. In fact it’s absolutely heartbreaking!
Paetyn never complains and is tending to try & carry on. It's a concern to Paetyn thinking how to survive financially if he cannot contribute by working. We reassure him not to worry and to focus on treatment and fighting this. It's easy to think so far ahead, so we are trying to remember to live day to day. He has been really focusing on making memories and spending lots of time with his brothers and sisters. The importance of family is never lost in times like this, and we are a strong wee family of 8!!!
If anyone one has any suggestions for CK levels, severe back and muscle pain we'd be keen for your input. Low cost treatments would be ideal, Please look our fb page up “patrick-leisha lockley” and PM us.
We might not reply straight away but will try to respond.
Thank you all for helping my son fight this, we are truly grateful to all.
From Paetyn’s Mum

Update on Paetyn
20 August 2023
Paetyn’s CK levels have increased which is a sign of muscle damage/muscle wasting, this is a side effect of his treatment drug. Bloods are weekly now & hoping the ck levels stabilize. Paetyn’s had days of not being able to get up and extreme exhaustion that even sitting up drains his energy. A bit of vomiting here & there but still spirits are high.
Work have been amazing to him & are doing all they can to ensure he is safe in the workplace & able to do all he can. Obviously Paetyn has a work ethic that makes his desire to do his upmost to work through all the chemotherapy side effects but this isn't always possible, so he has had to have a bit of time off too. Paetyn feels very humbled at people's generousity in supporting him to access this opportunity of treatment. We continue to tell him not to worry about the funds to get treatment, to just focus on what he can do and enjoy life, continue to live and that the funding of his chemotherapy should not be his worry thats mum (me) and dad (patricks) burden to carry & ensure his access. We are a long way off ensuring enough funds for at least 18 months of treatment.
So again, please share if you can or contact me with fundraising ideas. We are incredibly greatful to all whom have shared his give a little page so far or donated

A message from Paetyn’s mum
27 July 2023
We'd just like to express that we are all in incredibly thankful and humbled by everyone's support. The messages of support and love from all walks of life are so uplifting. Paetyn is nearly 3 weeks on his treatment and has had a reaction earlier on which caused a severe rash on his entire body. It is settling down and he has been able to continue his chemotherapy treatment - the plan is at least 18 months. Paetyn is in good spirits as he has noticed a small growth he had on his neck that wasn't of clinical concern has even shrunk. So we are hopeful that it is doing the same for his perennial nerve sheath tumor. We just want to thank everyone for becoming our village. Our family are firm believers of what you send out, you get back, karma or whatever term you use. So we thank you so very much. We feel the community support and love for paetyn. We are hopeful that both the access to the chemo and the energy we are being sent in love will transcend to successful treatment results.
Thank you so much, from paetyns mum.

Ruth is only 40 years old, lives on the Kapiti coast with her husband Andrew and their two young children, aged 9 and 6. Her diagnosis has come as a total shock, and we are all reeling with shock.
Ruth has undergone numerous invasive procedures, and is now on a journey through gruelling chemotherapy treatments every fortnight in Wellington for the next 5 months.
While completing treatment Ruth is unable to work, or even transport herself to the hospital. Ruth had just won a scholarship to start a PhD in Industrial Design, however this sudden diagnosis has meant she has now had to put this on hold. Her husband Andrew has significantly reduced his workload to part time hours to focus on caring for Ruth, as well as for the children and home.
Your support will go to keeping a roof over their heads and your help will keep food on the table, provide childcare when Ruth is in treatment, transport to hospital, and will help Ruth to spend as much precious time with her children and family as possible.
We are holding our breath waiting for the results from Ruth’s next scan, which will determine further treatment and prognosis.
It is difficult for Ruth to ask for help. She means the world to us, but to her little kids she is the whole world, and she wants nothing more than a future with her family, so thank you in advance for your love and support.

Update 30/5/24: Ruth has had the results from the latest CT scan (to see if the current chemotherapy treatment is working) the scan however showed the cancer has grown a bit more since the last scan in March so next week Ruth will be starting a different chemotherapy treatment, which will hopefully do the trick, if not, the next course of action will be some unfunded drugs.

I am a 25 year old trans woman living in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa. I am a writer, artist and creative, and have been on Hormone Replacement Therapy for 2 years, and while this has been a wonderful and affirming start to my transition, I need gender affirming surgery (SRS/bottom surgery) to feel a will to live in the body I am currently existing in. I am a beneficiary, unfit to work, without any immediately family support, so I need to reach out to the community for help.
This is urgent. I am in a lot of pain. My body does not belong to me. Considering the long wait times and high price in this country, my mental health is on the line, and I know so deeply that this change will bring confidence, satisfaction and a sense of belonging to my life. It goes without saying that this is for very personal reasons and is not cosmetic.
Unfortunately there is only one surgeon in Aotearoa, with a waiting list of over ten years publicly, and a price of over 50K NZD to get it done privately. I have done research and talked to the community, and wish to get my surgery done by a preferred surgeon in Bangkok, Thailand.

There is only 1 treatment option available (DRd daratumumab subcutaneous lenalidomide dexamethesone) which will get him enough time to get to the clinical trial but unfortunately, it isn't funded in New Zealand.

Dad had his first injection of Daratumamab on 22nd of May and has now had a total of 3 injections and we should find out if it is working in the coming weeks.
He has spent quite a bit of time in and out of hospital struggling to keep his HB and platelet levels up as well so he has needed quite a few blood transfusions. He has also been admitted again over the last couple days with pneumonia.
We we able to fund the first month thanks to the donations received thus far.
The pain has been getting pretty bad so he had to spend a couple nights at hospice trying to sort out the right medication to get the pain under control.

Her main condition is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). Just recently diagnosed are rare syndromes collectively known as Abdominal Vascular Compression Syndromes (AVCs).
AVCs are a group of rare, serious, life threatening conditions which in Georgia’s case, are as a result of her abdominal structures being too “loose” and stretchy, pushing on the abdominal blood vessels and small bowel. Within this group of syndromes, Georgia has the specific diagnoses of Nutcracker Syndrome, severe May-Thurner Syndrome, and probable Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome. These compressions are progressive and life threatening, leaving Georgia mostly bed bound, living in agonising pain, constant nausea, and dependent on a feeding tube.
We have been told by specialists in New Zealand that her only option is to travel to Germany and receive highly specialised surgery. This process has been quoted to cost 180,000 NZD. The treatment is extremely time sensitive as she is deteriorating each day, chances of long term survival are slim according to her specialist.
Georgia is a medical student and working in medical research. The decline in her health this year has meant that she has had to defer her studies and put them on hold. She needs this surgery to get her life back and follow her passion of helping others.
For her full story, please look on the Facebook Page ""Georgia's Health Page"", as the space available in this description is very limited.

23 October 2023
Kia ora whānau,
Georgia and Maria have left messages to thank each donor for their incredibly kind donations and words of encouragement but we'd just like to include in this update another massive thank you, ngā mihi nui. We are beyond grateful for every donation, share, comment, and aroha that comes along with it.
The surgery date we have been given for Georgia is 21 November. We are currently liaising with multiple people while planning this journey to make sure it runs as smoothly as possible. Life for our whānau has been difficult lately while caring for an elderly grandparent who is now hospitalised, both parents of Georgia's working full time jobs, planning travel, and organising everything else that life throws at us (which is unfortunately quite a lot right now). We thank everyone who has shared this GiveaLittle page on social media thus far. As the surgery and travel dates are so very close, we would be incredibly appreciative if this page could be shared, or even re shared if possible, on social media, at workplaces, with friends and whānau, or anywhere else you believe to be appropriate.
The words of encouragement, the donations, the kind comments, and every piece of support in any form, has been incredibly beautiful. To see our community coming together to support Georgia and her whānau is beautiful. Again, thank you to everyone for your role in being a part of her journey.
Arohanui, (our deepest love) - Georgia and whānau have written this update xx

He smashed his L1 vertebrae and was flown by rescue helicopter to Christchurch. Ollie had emergency surgery which went really well, but at this stage we don’t know if Ollie will get full function of his lower legs/feet again. Regardless, it’s a serious life changing injury and doctors advise that there will likely be around 5-6 months of rehabilitation at Burwood spinal unit in Christchurch. The family acknowledges the support received from the NZ Rugby Union Foundation, from the local rugby club, and of course there will be support from ACC.
However there will be lots of challenges ahead, including immediate financial pressures for the family as they temporarily relocate to Christchurch to support Ollie in his recovery.
Many friends have already asked how they can help. Ollie is receiving the best possible care from medical professionals at Burwood. However any help with the immediate financial pressures would be greatly appreciated.
If you would like to make a contribution to help Ollie and family, all funds received will go into a separate account to directly assist Ollie in his challenges ahead. Ollie wants to get back to his plumbing apprenticeship and get back to his flat and his independent life in Whanganui. Any amount you can contribute towards these goals would be gratefully received.

Her journey ahead is fraught with uncertainty, but the support from friends, family, and the wider community has been incredible. In response to many asking how they can tangibly help, we've set up this Givealittle page to alleviate the burden of the endless costs that lie ahead.
Crystal has begun the battle with her first of four rounds of intense chemotherapy at Waikato Hospital, spanning over four months. If health permits, she may have the chance to return home for a week each month to be with her beautiful 10-month-old daughter Zoey and her husband, Ethan.
Following this, if all goes well, Crystal will undergo a bone marrow transplant at Auckland Hospital, this may take another 4-6 months between hospital stays and motel accommodations, requiring round-the-clock care from family.
This journey presents challenges beyond medical ones. Ethan had to make the decision to temporarily leave his job to care for Zoey and support Crystal, leaving the family without a stable income.
Additionally, Crystal's inability to work further compounds their financial strain.
Your contributions can help ease the burden of loss of income, accommodation costs, childcare costs and travel costs allowing Crystal to focus on her well-being.
Your support, however big or small, will have a meaningful impact on their lives during this challenging time.
Thank you for your kindness and support.

THE NEXT STAGE OF THE JOURNEY
7 June 2024
Thank you to all of you for your kind and generous donations so far.
The last few months have been pretty tough (to say the least) on Crystal and the doctors are wanting her to have her Bone Marrow Transplant ASAP which means she is going to have to head down to Wellington in just over a week to start testing, Busulfan Chemotherapy and various infusions and all going to plan have her Bone Marrow transplant on her Birthday. She will then spend the next 4 (or more) months down there. Fortunately her brother Aaron was a match so he will be donating his Stem Cells and her husband Ethan will be heading down to be by her side on the long road ahead.
Her little girl Zoey will be back here in Cooks Beach with her Grandma Donna for the duration until Crystal is well enough to see them, that timeframe is unknown.
Any further support would be so gratefully appreciated at this continued heartbreaking time, any amount no matter how small helps xx

Hello,
Thank you deeply for your donation! Your kindness means the world to me, and I cannot express enough gratitude for the support I've received.
An update on my journey: The past two months have been incredibly challenging as I've navigated the biggest change of my life, both physically and mentally. Despite the hardships, I cherish my good days when I feel well enough to go out and do things. Today marks my 5th round of chemo, which I always approach with apprehension due to the side effects. Over the next week, I anticipate sleeping most of the time and managing these effects as best as I can.
I'm also pleased to share that I'm in a better place mentally and am now ready to share more of my journey. I'm prioritising my quality of life and creating meaningful memories, as I've come to realise this is most important when time is so limited.
Thank you once again for your kindness and support. Your generosity is deeply appreciated, and I wish you all a full life filled with so much joy and love!
Warmest regards,
Dominique.

The whānau know that the mauri at home is the ultimate in healing and are looking to bring her home as soon as they can.
Those of you that know Ana and her whānau know that the Rongonui, Rangihaeata, Gray whānau have provided endless support to many kaupapa over the years.

Renee was diagnosed with Stage 1 cervical cancer when she was 36 weeks pregnant with her boy Wolf. Having a baby and partner to love is something Renee has always dreamed of, therefore, to have this happen at such a special time in her life is something most of us could never truly comprehend.
At 37 weeks pregnant Wolf was born via C-section which was then immediately followed by major life saving surgery to remove the tumour, her reproductive organs and lymph nodes. She continued on to have radiation treatment. After this she was given the green light that she was in remission.
Exactly one year later just before Wolfs first birthday, Ren landed in the emergency department with what was thought to be pneumonia. It was uncovered there was a mass on her lungs, and she was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer.
The diagnosis was not taken lying down. Ren told the oncologist to get F$&@# % you don’t know me and what I’m capable of, I will be treated and I will beat this. We Know Ren will do exactly that. Once Renee finishes her 6th round of Chemo, she is planning on going to Mexico for alternative treatment.

MALS
Nutcracker
May Thurner syndrome.

Yesterday at the Clive market I was able to talk to many people about Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and how it affects the body, sharing information raises the awareness of how the abdominal vascular compressions affect the body and why surgery becomes life saving.
Jam, baking, flowers and jewellery were sold and a raffle kindly provided by mitre 10 all help to raise money for Caitlin’s surgery.
I am excited to say I have made a calculated leap and booked her surgery for 22nd August 2024. The race is on to raise funds, ( yes, many sleepless nights😊)
It is wonderful to hear of those returned having had this specialised surgery show significant improvement.
I am very grateful for everyone’s kind wishes and help in getting us to Germany.

Thankful to wonderful people like Tina and her team who are running a fundraiser quiz this Friday and Latteys engineering who are organising a fundraising event for 6th July.
My heart goes out to all family’s struggling with this condition. As specialists become knowledgeable in diagnosing there will be more families fighting a system that does not want to help. It’s exhausting and frighting.
Please continue to share these story’s, The more people talk about it the closer we get to having pressure put on our DHBs to assist.

I wanted to take a moment to thank everybody for your good wishes and donations.
It’s indeed humbling to have your help in getting Caitlin to Germany, as I learn more from others who have had this much needed operation it astounds me that our DHB do not want to help.
The excuse of “ experimental” is just not good enough for all the young adults needing the life saving surgery that is available. Until March last year it was funded through Te WhataOra. Living with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome is hard enough with all the complications that go with it.
Continual fainting ( PoTS)
Dislocations/ subluxations on a daily basis.
Debilitating pain caused by eating ( compressions)
Stomach/ bowel motility issues
Chronic fatigue, and the list goes on
To have then being diagnosed with abdominal vascular compressions which are life threatening and fail to help when surgery is available and NZ surgeons who want to perform this surgery in NZ but are being blocked from doing so is heartbreaking.
How many more need to die ?
Please help all those suffering by spreading information and raising awareness.
In the meantime we push on with the help of friends and the wonderful generosity of friends we have not met. I will be forever grateful for your help.

Health deteriorating
19 February 2024
It’s been awhile since my last post. Caitlin’s ( bean) health is deteriorating with serious talks around the need for nasal gastric feeding, something we have desperately tried to avoid. Getting to Germany is vital.
On a positive note when we recently saw Dr Burling he was able to show us in x-ray photos the connection of compressions being responsible for the terrible back pain experienced every day. Really encouraging to know that the operation in Germany will alleviate this too. It’s the combination of back pain and overwhelming nausea that confines her to bed every day and has her on multiple medications. How wonderful it would be to have reduced pain and be able to come off some medication. This combined with being able to eat without pain is not only life changing but potentially life saving too.
Please continue to share our story🦓

From individual donations to the wonderful love and support shown over the last 2 days with K- Studio generously donating followed by the benefit concert today which raised $3600.
Raising awareness of this condition not only helps us but everyone to follow. We are so hopeful that this surgery will one day take place in NZ. Progress is happening. Sadly not in time for us, we need to go to Germany and appreciate the efforts of everyone helping us.

Wonderful support
20 October 2023
Thankyou everyone for your wonderful support.
This is such a daunting task to raise this sum of money.
I reflect on Caitlin ( beans) life and how hard it has been. From the age of 11 when she was first admitted into hospital with stomach pain to so many years later now that we finally have answers.
Pubity saw many changes in her health with stomach issues getting worse to dislocations. So many times being told her pain was “ emotional” .
Testament to her inner strength to cope from the hospital overdose ( respiratory arrest) to being told to apply for euthanasia. Her mental health heavily tested.
I will never stop fighting for her and she deserves a chance at life, not just lying in bed day after day too sick or in too much pain to get up.
Please please continue to share her story.
Thankyou so much💞
This operation will allow her to eat and have significant pain reduction.

I'm so sorry to hear this and wish you the best. I wanted to let you know something I've come across is a grounding mat that goes on your bed while you sleep and reviews have said how much better they have slept, reduce pain and even less medication. Grounding.com or grounding.co.nz there are also usa websites to buy them from. Just wanted to let you know. Also have a look at collodial silver and collodial gold have helped lots of people.

It is diagnosed as 'Severe Functional GI Disorder'. He can only eat with unfunded strongly fermented probiotic drinks to subdue gut superbugs. Funds raised will last only roughly 2.5 more months, so we must raise enough for more months urgently or his life is at risk. The symptoms are severe.
His specialist advises that he do this ""as long as possible"" for the safety of future medication use. The bacteria have developed resistance to previous antibiotics, increasing the risk of further mutation. So I set a fundraising goal for over a year's costs.
Probiotic culture, fermentation ingredients, & nutrients/supplements are roughly $1075 monthly. Not counting electricity costs for warming up the oven for fermenting jars many times daily. More info:
• Diet is limited to 3 items of food
• Was hospitalized from Nov-Jan 22/23 & for a week in Feb/23
• Lower legs & feet were paralyzed. They improve slowly only as his condition does
• How well he is depends on how each meal goes
• Condition advanced from severe 'Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth' to 'Severe Functional GI Disorder' due to antibiotic-induced bacterial mutation
• Govt disability max is $70/week. So far in 2024, he gets $51.42 for this.

28 March 2024
Thank you all for your help so far. My brother could not afford to eat any kind of food at all without the help you gave in these last few months. He never imagined he would have this level of support.
He had a severe reaction to a meal a few weeks ago which made him very unwell for a few weeks although he is now better. More importantly, he has no specialist at the moment because the one assigned by the government cannot deal with this complex case. His GP is trying to get the govt to assign him a different specialist.
We are afraid of needing to go private. A big issue as this would mean he can't use the money for fermented drinks as long.
This is the update - otherwise, there is nothing new. He is just doing what he needs to do, every day is taken up by arranging every meal and little else.
Thank you!

April asks
Hello Amira, does your brother know about Faecal Microbiota (poo) Transplants (FMT)? Where the gut microbiota is cleared out and new pure bacteria is implanted in the gut - starting from scratch with good bacteria. I'm not sure who does it in New Zealand but it's become quite common in Australia. I'll post a link to a new article, but if you Google ""Faecal Microbiota Transplant Australia"" you'll find links to various gastro specialists who perform this procedure. My daughter has major gut issues and I'm hoping that FMT will be a help to her when she's old enough to receive treatment. I wish your brother all the best but I feel his gut needs to be cleared out and repopulated with good stuff. He might also like to consult a holistic naturopath and/or homeopath. https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/13/a-coup-for-poo-why-the-worlds-first-faecal-transplant-approval-matters
Amira
Hi April,
First, this is not Amira but her brother. Amira can't answer this question, she doesn't know the details enough. Also, I am very very sorry for the delay I had a severe reaction to a meal a few weeks ago and its effects persist for ages as it causes bacteria numbers to grow.
I am aware of FMT. It would have helped early if it were available. Although only in the lower bowel (small intestine is the upper bowel I did have overgrowth also in the lower bowel).
Currently, this is sadly tricky because the bugs have mutated so much that they eat anything organic - including fecal matter. So no one is sure how it would react to FMT. My guess - and it is just a guess based on how it behaves when I eat and with the current situation - is that would help my lower bowel but not my upper bowel ONLY IF I also take the kefir.
You see, strangely, the kefir is of a specific type. The same strains and substrains that caused the problem in the first place. I tried so many kinds, but nothing worked, including traditional kefir grains of many types. The bacteria are only subdued by this one product. My guess and that of doctors is that it is because the bugs do not attack their kind but attack other bacteria. Or are subdued by their kind but not subdued by other bacteria.
As you can see it is a maddeningly complex matter and I find it agonizing. despite the delay, which I hope you forgive me for, I want to express my gratitude for your message and suggestion. I appreciate this kind of support very much especially when it comes from strangers.
Sincerely,
Ahmed"

She requires immediate chemotherapy treatment which is starting 20th Dec 23, followed by surgery and ongoing radiation.
She did everything right in July when she noticed 2 lumps. She went for an ultrasound and was told they were firboadenomas which aren't harmful. When they changed late October and she noticed new lumps she went back to her Dr who then referred her for another ultrasound and biopsy. 2 of the lumps come back as positive for cancer. It has also spread to her lymph node at this point.
Due to the aggressiveness of her cancer she has just undergone egg preservation and is about to start round 1 of 6 chemo sessions.
Unfortunately she needs a drug called pertuzumab which is not funded in Aotearoa.
Her oncologist has said this drug increases pathological complete response rates by about 10% from a baseline of 40% for triple receptor positive disease. Achieving a pathCR strongly predicts for an individual having a higher long term disease free survival (cure rate).
She needs this drug for the last 3 rounds of chemo starting 21st Feb 23.
Robyn never asks for help and is always the one helping others with whatever life throws at them. It would be great if we can all get behind her in her time of need.
Use of funds
This money will be used for an unfunded drug (pertuzumab) to give her the best chances of being cured.

1 July 2024
Manawatia a Matariki ✨️
We started this jorney at the end of last year and we finish it at the start of the tau hou Maori.
Just like that radiation is done. The first session I was overwhelmed and terrified, as I didn't know what to expect. The unknown can be frightening. The nurses were lovely and explained everything to me, they were very patient and allowed me time to process what they were telling me as I stood there crying. All of the other sessions that followed were a breeze. Zach got to come in and watch them set me up. At the mapping appointment, they give you 4 little tattoos, which they use to line you up on the table. Everything about your body position has been calculated. From the height of the table to the height of each arm, the distance of your chin from your chest. You are aligned using lasers with the prison tats as markers. From there, they get an x ray and overlay it with the previous to make sure everything is still the same. Then, the radiation arm comes around and adjusts to the treatment area and does its thing. It's about 20 minutes all up, and no pain is involved. Over the next 2 weeks is when I may start to have skin reactions and fatigue. Fingers crossed these are the only side effects I have.
Now I just have 3 more Herceptin treatments via
I'm not so sure it has all sunk in yet. The last 7 ish months have been a Rollercoaster.
Thanks for the support, everyone.

Drum roll please

Results are in.....
Robyn is now considered to be in Complete remission. The pathology results showed no signs of cancer. This means that the chemotherapy completely killed the tumors. No signs of cancer have been found in the breast tissue or lymph nodes that were removed. She now moves onto 6 months of treatment to ensure any leftover cancer cells are wiped out. We are beyond happy with this news, it has made the hard times through chemo all worth it. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou katoa.

Kicking Cancer's butt
20 April 2024
Hey everyone, We got some great news this week. My MRI shows a complete response to the chemotherapy. This means my tumors are gone and no signs of cancer. My surgery will also be less invasive now as they will just be removing some tissue around where the clips are instead of a lumpectomy. This will then be sent away to be tested to see if there is any cancer in it. Once im healed from this I will start radiation to zap the area to be sure it is all clear.
Thank you all for your support on this jorney, we still have a way to go but this is great news I just had to share it with you all.

Round 6 fight
3 April 2024
What a day! Today was my last chemo session. 6 of 6 complete including the 3 unfunded sessions completed. Boy oh boy has it been a journey. This is only the first chapter of many more to follow but it feels so good to have been able to ring the bell today. A bell that we got made to donate to the hospital so that others can share in the tradition started by a US Navy officer many years ago. As well as the feeling of achievement ringing it, I got a bit emotional and Zach said he was nearly crying too.
What's next you ask, I have an MRI next week to track how I have responded and inform the decision for surgery.
The surgery will also inform the decision for the radiation treatment moving forward. It was planned for 1 month of this.
I found out yesterday that I have to have 9 rounds of Herceptin via IV, I have had 3 rounds already. This was a huge shock as I thought this chapter was via oral medication and not more needles in my arm and more time in hospital. I did'nt sleep lastnight due to this and have been a bit upset. It is an anti cancer drug and improves my chances of the cancer being stopped from coming back.
Thanks for all the love and support following this journey. We have come so far but still have a long road ahead. Now it is time to rest and recover.

Round 5, fight!

Wow round 5 of chemo just completed. The ice bucket for an hour is a treat, had some cute mittens to wear today to keep my hands warm. Yesterday was round 2 of the unfunded drug and 1 more round of each in 3 weeks. I can't believe the end is in sight, im so excited to put this chapter of treatment behind me. Im still having a positive response to treatment which is great and helps me to get through when times are tough. Thank you everyone for your support, prayers and messages/calls checking in on me. Im doing good, lots of hard times but remaining positive. Have a great week.

Round 3 Fight
6 February 2024
Kia ora everyone, feels like forever since I have posted an update. Round 3 of chemo done and dusted. Officialy half way through this regime of treatment. I was really knocked this round with fatigue and have only just started to feel ok tonight.
Round 4 we start a new cocktail of meds which i have to put my fingers in bags of ice to stop my nails falling out, as well as the unfunded drug, thanks to all you wonderful people. Ngā mihi nui 🤎🤎🤎
This round im thankful to a friend for checking in a couple of days ago, who kindly reminded me to be kind to myself. My body is fighting this dammmm cancer, and it also needs time to heal after the fight. At times it all feels too much to handle but i know i have a wonderful community of humans supporting me. For this I am beyond thankful.

Kia ora koutou katoa,
I trust everyone has had an amazing summer holiday doing what brings you joy with the people you love.
I have just finished round 2 of Chemo and heading home for some rest. Not much else has been going on, we know what to expect now having done 1 round previously so we are into the swing of things and have our new routine on lock.
Interesting facts, i can no longer taste Whitakers creamy milk but i can taste the dark chocolate one. I cant taste nutella or tomatoe sauce, this is a bit sad as the good Kiwi I am, i enjoy tomatoe sauce with most things.
That's all for now, have a beautiful day.

Whakawhetai - Gratitude
We bought this journal before i was diagnosed as im a glass half full kind of girl and love to be mindful and grateful for all things in life. Just realised i havent written in it since.
Lastnight i was washing my hair and noticed a steady stream of hair being washed away. I screamed out to Zach, then i cried in the shower for a few minutes while he told me it was going to be ok & that we were expecting this to happen. It was at that point i realised what i was grateful for.
1. I had prepared for this day by getting gradual haircuts.
2. It was just short hair falling out and not my long hair coming out in clumps in my hand. That would have been so much harder to deal with.
3. The chemo drugs are doing there thing and this is just part of the process.
4. My hair doesnt define who i am.
5. Cancer doesnt effect my smile, so i can keep smiling and being me as my smile represents me more than my hair ever will.
6. My hair will grow back eventually.
And so, as Zach sat at the barbers getting a haircut today i decided i was going to do something fun with my hair while i still have it. What 35 year old gets this kind of style you may ask. Hi, its me 🙃 ""Im Batman""

In less than 48 hours we have reached our goal as well as covering the give a little fee. Zach and I are absolutely blown away by the love you have all shown me. Every message, every share of the page, every koha and every prayer has been seen and felt as well as bringing me to tears it has filled my ngakau (heart) with so much warmth.
I know some people are still wanting to donate next week so i have decided to keep the page running. The funds given above our goal amount (that we have just reached, somebody pinch me) will be used to help us while Zach is off work caring for me.
A whakatauki i used in my vows in October was as follows:
Mā te ngākau aroha koe e ārahi.
Let a loving heart guide you.
It is something i try to do in life and it is what you all have done to help me. Thank you will never be enough.

It wasn't a journey that I wanted to make public but we need the help to get this rongoa (medicine) to give me a better fighting chance.
Update Tahi
We had my first round of chemo today and just arrived home. Feeling a bit tired and dizzy, thus rest is on the cards very shortly. A friend told me to think of the chemo as rongoa thats going to help me feel better, and that really helped me to not be as anxious and scared.

Successful Portacath Insertion Procedure
10 January 2024
Dear Friends,
I hope this message finds you well. Today, I would like to give you an update about my wife. Today, on January 9, 2024, my wife underwent a minor surgery to have a PortaCath attached. This device will be used to administer her chemotherapy medication as she embarks on a challenging journey to fight against a rare and aggressive form of cancer. She will be undergoing 12 cycles of chemotherapy, with each cycle costing us Php. 25,000.
We are determined to provide her with the best possible care and treatment to ensure her well-being and increase her chances of overcoming this battle. However, the cost of each chemotherapy session is quite substantial, and we are reaching out for support. Your generous contribution can make a significant difference in helping us afford the necessary medication and give her the fighting chance she deserves.
Together, we can be a source of hope and strength for my cousin as she faces this difficult challenge. Your donation, no matter the amount, will not only alleviate the financial burden on our family but also contribute to her overall well-being and healing process. Let's come together and make a positive impact in her life by supporting her in this fight against cancer.
Every donation, no matter how small, can make a significant impact on her journey towards recovery.
Truly Yours,
Willard

""An Update on My Wife's Condition: Successful Surgery, Gratitude, and Continued Journey""
19 December 2023
I wanted to provide you all with an update on my wife's condition. I am happy to inform you that her surgery was successful, and she was discharged a few days ago. She is currently at home, resting and regaining her strength. In December, she will be scheduled for radiation and chemotherapy as part of her ongoing treatment.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to each and every one of you for your unwavering support, generous donations, and heartfelt prayers. Your assistance has truly made a difference in our lives. However, our journey is far from over as we continue to prepare for the upcoming radiation and chemotherapy sessions.
Although I have already requested donations, I humbly admit that we still require additional funds for her treatment. Therefore, I am reaching out to you once again, with a plea for your prayers and contributions. Your continued support will be immensely appreciated.
On behalf of my wife, our two daughters, and myself, I want to express my heartfelt thanks for everything you have done for us. Your kindness and compassion have touched our hearts in ways words cannot fully express.

They met in Portiuncula hospital where they both worked. Jason has 2 boys from his previous marriage, Daniel & Gavin.
They moved to New Zealand in 2009, and had their beautiful little girl Aisling in 2017. They got married in 2019.
Everything was going well until July of this year when they got the devastating news Jason had been diagnosed with 2 brain tumours, followed by the news that it originated in his kidney and a further 2 brain tumours. Since then Jason has not been able to work and Diane has had to take a considerable amount of time off work to be there for her husband during appointments and surgery and recovery.
Jason’s sick leave from nz police is coming to an end and treatment is coming at a considerable cost. Insurance has covered a good lot, but further related costs, such as scans, physio, specialist appointments etc (at this time we don’t know exactly the cost).. are adding up quickly and I’d love if us as their family and friends could help with some of these costs and take a little bit of their financial stress away.

Treatment update
2 April 2024
Hi everyone just a wee update it's been awhile! Happy to say treatment is going pretty well. There have been some side effects which have been hard going at times for Jason but he's handling it like a pro. He even went back to work part-time 2 weeks ago! His next scan is happening 10th April so please send positive vibes for that. It will give us an idea how well the immunotherapy it working. We are also planning a trip home July/August so hopefully we can have some catch up with you all :) thanks again for all the donations and support we really appreciate it! 💕

Thank you so much for your generous donations, Jason and Diane are truly blown away by your generosity, knowing so many people are thinking of them has given them a huge boost!
This money will not only pay bills but it’s 1 less thing for them to be worrying about.
They have a long road ahead of them and have no idea what costs might come along so that’s why I increased the goal.
I know this is a tough time of year to be donating so thank you from the bottom of my heart.

The life of Sonya Boereboom from August 2022.
Starting with pain in my back, thought I had a pinched nerve, then started having numbness and tingles in my legs. Within two days got admitted to hospital and ended up paralysed from the waist down. After extensive hospital investigations, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called MOGAD which is a rare inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system. Months of intensive treatment to manage it followed.
Unfortunately then I slipped on wet tiles at work, fell over and broke my left femur at my hip joint in January 2023. And so began twelve weeks in a wheelchair while still getting used to MOGAD.
However, just when things couldn’t possibly get any worse, in March 2023, I was diagnosed with an aggressive breast cancer and again a very rare one. Next came the first round of chemo, then radiation and then the second round of a different chemo, all of which had little success in slowing the cancer progression. Now I am on an unfunded option in the private hospital sector. This unfunded drug - Sacituzumab govitecan - is extremely expensive and is not covered by any form of insurance, so I am funding it myself. After two cycles of this, my latest CT scan has shown some improvement which is a positive, so, the plan is to continue with more cycles and hope for the best.

Another ED visit last Wednesday due to pain in my back and headaches. Was admitted and had a full round of scans. The results from this have shown more bone metastases have developed in my spine. Next step is localised radiation to my back, hopefully this will help with the pain. Nathan has his shoulder operation tomorrow, and if all goes well, he will have around six weeks recovery time.

Message from Sonya and Nathan
10 April 2024
Nathan and I would like to thank everybody who has made comments, liked, shared, donated and has supported us on our journey from the bottom of our hearts, we are extremely grateful. It means the world to us.
It is very humbling to know how much people care for others in this way. Times are tough for everyone, so we appreciate it.
Unfortunately, I have recently had issues and have had to put the Sacituzumab Govitecan on hold. In the meantime, I have switched to another chemo treatment at Mercy Hospital.
I have come so far but still have a long road ahead. Now it is time to see if this one does what is meant to do.
The new chemo I have started has its ups and down with side effects, but I am staying positive. Overall, I am doing really well.
Nathan has had a recent review of his shoulder and now is waiting on a date for surgery.
Once again thank you for all your support and donations, it is much appreciated!

Briefly, what will the money be spent on?
22 February 2024
We are a very independent family, and we never ask for help, so this is hard for us to accept this situation we are faced with.
Further treatment and support for Sonya's family
Costs $30,000 per cycle with no cap – 3 months is around $130,000.
Husband still working to support family and pay for chemo with a broken shoulder and living on painkillers every day.

Extra family info
22 February 2024
Some extra detail that wouldn't fit on the main description:
Just to add to the challenges of Sonya's life, her husband broke his collarbone 12 months ago January 4 th 2023 and got a bone infection after surgery to plate it. Twelve months later it has not bonded and is still broken (non-union). He is faced with more surgery including bone grafting from his femur. He will have a recovery period of around nine months with no guarantee of success.
All the while we are supporting our two sons through the challenges of our daily life. I want to keep fighting and beating this cancer to see my sons and family grow older and make precious memories.

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity, and we don't have a lot of options in the lower North Island yet so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best!

She was only 48 years old.
The cancer was bilateral, advanced, grade 3 and her best chance of survival was a double mastectomy, reconstruction surgery, a long course of chemo, followed by radiation.
Because of the Covid lockdowns, Caroline had to navigate her own diagnosis and pay privately to get the ball rolling, as our public health system was overwhelmed with Covid cases and limited services.
Caroline received all of her treatment with incredible strength and determination and was cancer free and in remission for 3 years, until ....
August 2023. Caroline had her annual checkup and received the worst possible news: the cancer has returned and is metastatic. It is present in her liver, lung and various bones.
Chemo treatment, to prolong what time she has left, commenced today on 10 August 2023.
Time is her most valuable asset, and we need to buy her precious time - time to spend it with her two children, two beautiful grandchildren and other family and friends.

My apologies for the delayed update it’s been a busy six months.
My health has taken a turn for the worse, and the medication I've been on is no longer working. I have been told that time is now limited as medical options are no longer having a positive effect.
I recently returned from a wonderful trip to Samoa with family and friends. We soaked up the warmth and the great company. Managed to snorkel with the giant clams and turtles. But the turtles were hiding from me!
I am doing well both emotionally and physically, under the circumstances. My plan is to spend as much time as possible with family and loved ones over the next few months.

Hello everyone,
Once again I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your support and kind wishes. I feel truely loved and supported during this difficult time and your generosity speaks volumes.
A lot has been happening over the past 4-5 months. From a treatment perspective my new treatment regime appears to be working which I started 2 weeks ago. I'm starting to feel a little more “normal” .
I don’t stray far from home of late, but I'm now doing more small tasks about the house independently . It’s a funny wee world when one is pretty happy about being able to do dishes and small house work jobs! It’s definitely the small things in life that can bring joy and a sense of normality.
I'm getting excited about Xmas and spending time with loved ones. I'm also thinking about making a small bucket list to work towards in the new year.
Once again, thank you for your support.
Love Caroline x

Not good news
13 October 2023
Hi everyone.
Sorry I haven't updated for a while, I was waiting for my CT scan on Friday 6th October to do my update.
Unfortunately the CT scan results were not what I expected or wanted to hear. The chemo hasn't worked to reduce the cancer in my liver or bones. In fact, it has increased.
This means I have to have a liver biopsy ASAP to ascertain what the next steps will be.
My original breast cancer in 2020 was receptor positive, so it seems the secondary cancer is different, or it has changed, which means the treatment plan I was on, didn't work. Once the oncologists have the biopsy results, they'll work out a different concoction of chemo that will hopefully reduce the tumors and slow the progression.
I've been incredibly sick during the recent chemo treatment which means I haven't been able to work, my concentration has gone, and I feel like I have the worst hangover every day, every hour, and that's without drinking a drop of alcohol! No fun at all.
I'm really disappointed and upset at this latest news, but hopeful that the next stage will be a chemo that works and doesn't make me feel like throwing up constantly.
Please wish me luck and spread my Give a Little page, I need all the help I can get right now.
Love and hugs to you all, Caroline xxx

Hi everyone
Once again thank you for all your support, kind words, and generosity.
I’m feel so blessed and humbled by everyone’s kindness.
It’s been four weeks since diagnosis and it’s been a big month full of appointments all over the place. Last week I had a portacath placed in my chest, it will make my interventions easier moving forward. Nothing worse than getting stabbed by needles all the time!
Maybe I could make it a new fashion accessory, maybe zhoosh it up and stick on sparkles! Watch this space lol
Today I’m receiving my second round of intravenous chemo. I’m hoping this time all will go well with no side affects.
Love Caroline x

It's been a whirlwind week since finding out.
13 August 2023
Thursday 10th August: My first chemotherapy treatment involved a batch of intravenous infusions (now, every three weeks for the rest of my life). It started off uneventful, then I unfortunately had an adverse reaction when my autoimmune system went into shock. Something called rigors. A very unpleasant event involving uncontrolled seizure-like shaking and coldness which felt like an unstoppable seizure for about 20 minutes. My sister Amanda was there with me and I'm grateful she was there to comfort me while we waited for the medication to kick in and stop the seizure. Next time they will likely preload me with meds to prevent this happening again. The staff were also very supportive which gives me some faith in the Whangarei Oncology Unit.
In the days that followed, the sickness has been coming in waves. I've been just taking it easy, waiting to see how my body responds to the infusions and oral chemo medications. I spent yesterday afternoon with my grandbabies and children.
Emotionally, it's a roller coaster. But I'm optimistic and driven to keep doing all the things I can, while I can.

This page has provided me with one less thing to worry about while I focus on getting my affairs in order and spending quality time with loved ones.
With my first fight with cancer in 2020, I was once told by one of my recently passed Aunties ""Caroline, I'm sure you will always live life well"". I will strive to live upto her words and be the bravest person I can. Over the next four months of treatment we will know more about how the cancer is going to respond.
Until my next update, all my love and a big cuddle for good measure. And thank you again for your support.

Caiden has grade 4 brain cancer which is every parents worst nightmare. Prognosis for DIPG is normally between 9 to 12 months, with radiation being the only treatment available to hopefully help prolong life. Survival rates are less than 1%.
Caiden started a clinical trial in June 2023, but sadly he had severe side effects from the chemo medications, & ended up being hospitalized for 7 weeks. Caidens mum & dad have always firmly believed that quality of life is paramount for Caiden, & because the drugs aren't guaranteed to prolong life & aren't a cure, they decided to take him off the trial medication & start giving him natural medicines to help his immune system have the best chance at fighting the cancer. Such a hard decision to make.
Natural medicines are costly & not subsidised, & there are huge costs associated with the ongoing consultations to be able to ensure Caiden is on the best combinations of medicines, to give his body the best chance at fighting against this evil monster.
Both mum and dad are not able to work so that they can give Caiden the best care possible, while spending quality time together as a family. Time is precious. They also have 3 other kids to care for alongside of Caiden. Money is very tight, & they are trying their very best as a family to do all they can for their beautiful boy, while holding onto hope for a miracle.
Some of the medicines include: Tumeric, CBD oil (a medical prescription for this has been provided to the Givealittle team) Sea Cucumber, Zinc, Vitamin D3, Vitamin C, TBL12, Turkey Tail mushroom sourced from the USA

Firstly we would just like to say a huge thank you for all your love, kindness and support. It really does take a village when you are going through such tragic circumstances, to help get through each and every day. Words can never describe how grateful we are to have crossed paths with you all in one way or another.
We have had some fantastic news from Caidens MRI scan yesterday. His tumour is responding to the radiotherapy treatment. We have had some shrinkage since his last scan 6 weeks ago!! This is such a relief to know that our decision to put him through another round of radiation, after finding out his tumour had doubled in size was the right decision to make. It's so scary as a parent having to make such huge life threatening decisions, in hope that it gives our son more quality time here with us.
We are still waiting for a cure.... radiation will only help for so long :( We just hope with every part of our being that a miracle cure happens in time for our son to receive it.
Meanwhile we are busy making precious memories, and planning our big trip to Australia, where Caiden can see all the birds and wildlife that he loves the most 🥰

Positive MRI update today
5 March 2024
Positive results from Caidens MRI today.
It's been 2 weeks today since Caidens radiation treatment ended... and we have no growth!! We can clearly see the radiation is doing its job killing off the cancer cells of the tumour in todays images, as the tumour diffusion is not as dense now as it was back in January.
Oncologist expected the tumour to look worse today as it has only been 2 weeks since treatment ended, and the targeted area will still be inflamed from treatment... but it looked better than she expected so early on which is such a relief. Generally they don't like to scan until at least 6 weeks post radiation.
Between his MRI in December and his last MRI in January the tumour almost doubled in size :( ... but today after completing radiation it has not grown since the last scan! :)
She said she didn't need to see the scan to see that he's responding to radiation as he's thriving and looking great. She is very happy with his radiation response so far 🥰
We hope that this honeymoon period for Caiden lasts a long time, and that radiation continues to kill those cancer cells 🙏

Caiden has completed his second round of radiation!
21 February 2024
Firstly we would like to thank each and every one of you for your continued love, prayers and support. We feel so grateful to have each and every one of you behind us, cheering our boy on from near and far.
Caiden completed his second round of radiation yesterday. He did 17 days of brain radiation under a general anesthetic, and handled it like a true champion. This little 6 year old boy skipped into the treatment room every single day with a smile. He knows that we are trying to shrink his naughty lump, and he wants to show this cancer who is boss! We hope a cure is found in time to save our son, as radiation is only a temporary treatment that may or may not help prolong his life. A person can only receive a limited amount of radiation treatments in their lifetime, so more treatment options need to be found to help these poor children.
Caiden is doing amazing at the moment. The oncologist is very pleased that we made the decision to reradiate as he has improved so much since his treatment began.
LONG MAY THE GOOD DAYS FULL OF QUALITY LAST!!
We ask that you all keep talking about Dipg to spread awareness, keep donating to foundations for more research. Because unless more funding gets applied into research for this deadly cancer, kids will continue to die.

I love to see Caiden and his birds, he has such a beautiful soul. Has the doctor(s) suggested boswellia also known as frankincense? I know every child is different and can't take the same things. But I figured it was worth a shot to mention it. Keeping the whole family in my prayers 🤗
Caidens second round of radiation
5 February 2024
Caiden has completed 7 days out of 17 days of his second round of radiation. This 6 year old boy goes in every day with a smile on his face, skipping and walking with a bounce in his stride. He skips into the treatment room smiling, joking and giggling with the nurses. He knows that he will be put to sleep, have his head bolted down to a table with his mask on every time he goes into that room.. but he never complains. The nurses are so lovely, kind and caring. He gets to choose a bead of courage every day, and put a bird sticker onto his aviary sticker board they kindly made for him to help count down the days of treatment. They are so good with the children it's so beautiful in a life full of heaviness.
As you walk through the cancer treatment centre that is mixed with adults and children, you can see the sadness in the adults eyes as you walk past them. Its hard for them to see an innocent child has to go through things that most people will never have to go through in a lifetime, and they know better than anyone what it's like to have radiation.
Our days are filled with doing all the things that the kids love, making precious memories that we can cherish for eternity. We live and breathe for our children.
We are so thankful to each and every one of you for walking through this nightmare with us and lighting the way so that we can see through all the darkness. You definitely make our lives brighter.

Sad News
18 January 2024
Sadly Caidens recent MRI on the 4th of January confirmed that his brain stem tumour is progressing. The tumour had grown alot in just 4 short weeks. We had been told by our oncologist that his MRI on the 7th of December looked concerning in areas, but because Caiden was still doing amazing we had hoped that they were wrong. But 3 weeks after that MRI we noticed Caidens symptoms started to increase. We are devastated.
We have had to make some huge decisions with regards to what we do from here to try and help our son. He is declining each day, and it's crucial to start radiation therapy before symptoms progress too much. Our other option is to do nothing and keep him as comfortable as possible, spending time together as a family until his little body decides it can't continue on any more. How does this even happen to children!? Our son is only 6 years old!
We have decided to do a second round of radiation treatment for Caiden. We know that Caiden would want to be here alongside us as long as he possibly could. He hates being away from us, he's never wanted to be anywhere that we aren't.
Radiation has very risky side effects. Because of the location of the brain tumour and the fact that this is his second round of radiation the risks are even higher. Caidens tumour responded well to radiation a year ago, so we hope with every part of our mind, body and soul that his tumour responds well this time.
Please pray for our beautiful boy.

Merry Christmas From our Family to Yours
30 December 2023
We hope that you have all had a memorable safe and happy Christmas with your loved ones.
We feel very lucky to have been blessed with another Christmas with our beautiful boy Caiden.
Caidens last MRI sadly showed some concerning results to the drs. He is scheduled to have a full brain and spine MRI on January the 10th. He has been having a few off days, but never complains. He never wants to worry us, and his worst fear is ending up back in hospital.
Please continue to pray for our beautiful boy.
We ask the universe every single day to save our son. He deserves to grow up and live a lifetime full of love and happiness.
We love and appreciate you all x
Happy new year from our family to yours 🎉
Soak in every moment with your loved ones. Enjoy one another, don't sweat the small stuff, love like there is no tomorrow. Life is a privilege that is sadly denied to many xx

Heartbreaking MRI Results
8 December 2023
Caiden had an MRI on Wednesday. He has been doing so amazing the last few months. Unfortunately the results of the MRI were not what we had hoped for. Based on how great he is doing we had expected to see a stable tumour or some shrinkage. Sadly all the medical team are concerned about some changes to his brain stem tumour. There is a new diffuse area that is starting to take over the cystic component of his tumour which is a cause for concern. When tumour progression begins that normally means a very rapid decline. Oncologist advises it's best to start another round of radiation before symptoms start to appear, but we are very hesitant. He's doing so well right now, & we don't want the quality of life that he has now to deteriorate with the radiation side effects.
Our Oncologist agrees with our decision to hold off on radiation until he starts to become symptomatic. We hope that this won't happen for a very long time, but if the symptoms do start to appear, we need to head into starship hospital immediately for another MRI.
It's such a strange feeling being told bad news while Caiden is at his best. It almost doesn't feel real that things could start to take a turn for the worst at any moment.
We are making the most of the good days. Every moment he is doing great is an absolute blessing 💛
We are continuing to give Caiden all the natural medicines we have had him on for some time, & will add in some new ones too.
Thank you for all your support during our heartbreak.

Caiden has reached a 12 month Milestone
15 November 2023
Caiden has reached a 12 month Milestone that is denied to many children fighting DIPG brain tumours. Yesterday marked 12 months since we found out that our beautiful boy has one of the deadliest brain cancers that mostly effects children aged between 4 and 11 years old. Prognosis is normally around 9 months for most children. Some sadly don't make it to the 9 month mark, and some children are lucky enough to continue fighting past 9 months. In such shitty circumstances we feel truly blessed to have our son here fighting. He's still here for us to cuddle, kiss, feel the warmth of his skin, create memories with, and watch him smile, laugh and sleep.
Caiden managed to go a whole day without using his wheelchair the other day. His mobility continues to get better as each day passes by. We are hopeful that it is all the natural supplements that we are giving him that is helping his immune system fight the cancer.
We thank each and every one of you for your continued love, support and prayers as we continue to battle through a living nightmare. All of your donations go towards the natural supplements he needs which is very costly, fulfilling his bucket list, and helping relieve the financial strain we are faced with now that both hubby and I aren't able to work. Quality time together is paramount to us, as tomorrow is never promised.
Every morning he wakes up smiling and is still the same boy that he was the day before, is such a relief to us. Life is precious.

MRI results
11 October 2023
Hey guys
Firstly we'd just like to say a huge thank you for your continued love, support and prayers over the last 11 months. You all add light into our lives at our darkest moments, so thank you.
Caiden had his most recent MRI last week. They have labeled this MRI as inconclusive due to not wanting to label anything, and because they are not certain about what they can see on the scan. Caidens tumour has always looked different to other DIPG tumours, and because of his not being a typical looking tumour no one knows how his will react.
He will have another MRI scan in 7 weeks time to decide if they are seeing tumour progression, or if it is cystic fluid leaking into the cerebellum of the brain, or if it is radiation necrosis. We pray with all we have that it's not tumour progression.
Caiden has been very tired at times over the last couple of weeks, and his head has been feeling weird on and off. The cyst in the tumour is at its fullest at the moment, and that must be such an awful feeling for him and add extra pressure inside his brain.
We wish we could take this all away for him.... we wish it was us instead of him. It's soul destroying watching your child battle a terminal diagnosis and feel so helpless when our job as parents is to protect our children.
Throughout it all, Caiden still smiles... he still carries on and pushes through any obstacles that he is faced with, and continues to show cancer who is boss. He is forever our hero.

Prayers and Blessings always
Such a trooper!
8 September 2023
Caiden has been doing absolutely amazing! He has gained back so much strength, his cheeky mischievous personality is back, his speech is much clearer, and he is walking more than he is using his wheelchair at the moment. It is incredible to see such a huge improvement in him since we made the decision to take him off the chemotherapy trial medication, and start him on natural supplement therapy... we wish we had done this sooner! His quality of life is the best it has been in the last few weeks than it was for so many months after his diagnosis in November 2022.
There is still no cure for this evil monster... and this scares us every single day. With DIPG anything can change in an instant... tomorrow isn't promised. We are hoping with all we have that Caiden is granted a miracle cure 🙏
We continue to make precious memories together as a family, and enjoy every single moment with one another. Although money isn't important, it still helps ease the financial burden this has on our family since we have both given up our jobs to give Caiden the best care possible. Our family of 6 need each other more than we ever have right now ❤️ We still need to pay for every day living, pay for Caidens medicines, pay the bills, fufil Caidens bucket list... Sadly we cannot do these things without all of your help 😔 So thank you for all your love, kindness and support to date ❤️

Caidens 6th Birthday Milestone
21 August 2023
Hey everyone
Firstly we would like to thank you all for your support, love, kindness and prayers for our beautiful boy Caiden. You are all such beautiful souls, and we can't ever thank you enough 💖
Caiden had his 6th birthday on Friday 18th of August. We are so pleased that he has reached this birthday milestone given his diagnosis, and we hope and pray that he beats the odds and statistics, and has many more birthdays to come.
Caiden is doing incredible since we have introduced natural remedies to help fight his brain cancer. He has gained back so much strength, his personality is shining through again, and he is looking so much happier off the trial medication.
Quality of life is paramount to us for Caiden, and he is definitely getting that at the moment which makes us happy.

Kylie asks
Hi, my name is Kylie and I am so sorry to hear about Caiden's diagnosis.
I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners all around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with an incurable illness so that they can spend time together and make special memories with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. If living in Auckland, we also have a beautiful and very peaceful place in Waitakere called Mokoroa Retreat - as a close to home option (sleeping 6). Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie

At the time, Sarah and her sister Laura became orphans when their mother, Barbara, succumbed to melanoma in six short months. Like her mother, Sarah was devastatingly diagnosed with stage three melanoma in August 2023 by chance, when an observant doctor noticed her arm while taking her one year old to the GP for an ear infection.
Since then, a huge fundraising effort has taken place to support Sarah with the treatment she needs. However, this is only the bare minimum for the ongoing treatment costs involved in her healing journey. The treatment that Sarah is currently undergoing is immunotherapy, which can be lifesaving, but is very costly and not funded in New Zealand.
So, we are going to swim for Sarah. In turn, we need you to donate to her healing journey. You can make a donation through this page, or if you know someone participating in the swim event you could sponsor them per length e.g. $10 per lap, and make your contribution at the conclusion of the event on Sunday the 9th of June 2024 at 6pm.
Sarah is a loving mum to her two beautiful children Emma (4) and Hugo (1). She wants to do everything she can to ensure her children don’t grow up without a mum as she did.

This 1 in a million condition results in progressively severe irreversible blindness at young age, but some children have benefitted from gene therapy which is a medicine that can compensate for their specific genetic deficiency.
Hopefully this will help him improve his low vision, and most importantly, retain it for longer.
It's a big decision because they only have few spots available for this treatment and it's unlikely they will get funding for more; Ciro is eligible because he is still little and has healthy photoreceptors needed for the gene therapy (normally they deteriorate at 4-5 and it's too late then); there is a lot of theoretical risks, but it would take too long build precedents. We need to act now.
This new medicine has not been administered to many humans (only 4 children so far) and is not licensed, but is being made available to Ciro as a Special treatment on the basis of a Hospital Exemption. The surgery will be in London at the Evelina Children’s Hospital and we need to be there at least 6 weeks. With your help we are going to cover flights for Ciro's family, accomodation, food, medications and other unpredictable costs from theoretical risks from the treatment.

Finally, after feeling very, VERY nervous that anything could happen before or on surgery date, when the doctor came from the theatre to say that everything went as planned, I finally felt like a huge load on my back became lighter.
I'm so glad and grateful my brother was able to come and join before D-day, spend a beautiful time with Ciro and then be of great support while Ciro was in theatre and after. Specially those first two hours when anesthesia is still lingering and they feel so miserable.
The surgeon saw him on the following day, remove the eye patch and was very pleased how he was recovering.
We still have appointments from now on every week to make sure everything keeps staying normal.
But so far: Ciro sometimes complains about pain (every time Les and less), he is annoyed every time about the eye drops, but mainly he is VERY VERY happy.
Fingers crossed everything keeps progressing nicely
And again, we can't forget how we are here because people all around the world has helped us to make this happen for Ciro.
Although I'm here with him physically, I'm fueled by everyone's support and kindness.
Thanks again for helping us get here 🧡💛

UK timezones again
30 May 2024
We are finally back to London.
The flights were hard, some better than others.
Ciro is a strong boy on so many levels.
3 hours flight
1.15 wait
14 hours flight
4 hours wait
7 hours flight
1 hour drive
He made lots of new friends in the airplane
Kept asking people in English if they spoke Spanish
Asked to.go home several times
Asked about Dad and his sister, and grandparents
But also wondering about Ronald McDonald house, and thinking the people he would see again. He has such a good memory!
We played so many games and although I thought I was entertaining him, I think a lot of the times it was the other way round.
Remember that for someone with low vision TV isn't appealing so it's a long way LONG LONG way.
Ciro is excited to see his doctor again and we have been lucky to be staying with other families going through the same thing here at Ronald McDonald. If feels like an AIPL1 summit lol
A small group of children very lucky To have this opportunity.
Let hope everything keeps going well.
After last time, I do not dare to uncross my finger and toes 😁
Surgery is booked for 6th June
We'll keep you posted!

Stoked with big news
2 May 2024
Soooo
We are going back to the UK 💛
While we were back in NZ, back at work, routines and enjoying the last bit of Summer and a beautiful mild Autumn, the teams in the UK have been working hard to get an answer for us. A GREAT answer.
The surgeon has booked a surgery date: 6 June.
After witnessing the great results in one eye, we have no doubts in going back. Ciro's vision has improved at least 25%. He is seeing more, building his confidence and a lot happier.
The process is the same as the one back in January but this time we are going just Ciro and me. The experience it's not uncharted territory, so I feel confident I'll be able to support Ciro in every way possible. We still have a great network of friends, extended family and family who can help us while overseas and at home with Marcos.
The other family that has been part of this great adventure going through the same thing with their little 3 year old is also going. It will be wonderful to share this ride again with such a beautiful family.
Thanks for everyone who has asked about doing more fundraisers. We are very lucky, and grateful for all the support, because we still have enough funds to take Ciro to the other side of the world.
We are keeping this page ope because we learnt that there are unpredictable scenarios and we just want to be ready as much as possible for any of them. So if we do end up needing help of any sorts, we'll keep you posted.
This is all from us for now, but we'll be in touch :)

Ciro is very happy
10 April 2024
Although we haven't heard back from the UK team in regards to the second surgery (still unsure if it actually will happen), we are witness of Ciro's vision progress.
His vision on his right eye has improved at least 20%. He is moving around with lots of confidence and even exploring new places (indoor or outdoor) a lot more.
He is smiling all the time and he is asking a lot ""what is this"" pointing to pictures, drawings or objects around him in a distance that he wouldn't notice before.
We feel so grateful for the opportunity in giving Ciro this amazing ""gift"" and we are so conscious we wouldn't have done it without your support.
We'll keep you posted on and let's hope there will be more News soon

We are home
5 March 2024
If we thought it was already a rollercoaster, the last weeks have been Six Flags + Disney and Universal Studios altogether.
Unfortunately there was a bad timing between the Gene therapy ""expiring"", hospitals theatres and other politics. We are hoping the shell life of the gene therapy can be extended, the hospital approves and some other ""rocks"" on the way can be moved.
Once this happens, if it does, we can talk again with the team and hopefully we can come back for the second time, second eye, second chance. Lots of things need to fall into right place and although they Say it's unlikely, we still hope we can go back.
There are so many people involved, lots of work, risks and benefits to be assessed, that we want to thank everyone who has been part of it and helpes us achieve what we have so far. We won't forget them, and we Hope they don't forget us.
Most importantly, the first eye has recovered well and we have noticed changes in his vision.
Our main doctor has gone above and beyond. He has shown to be extremely professional, trusting and caring. A Huge thank you to him.
Also, we met the other family who was going through the same as us and I can say it has made a huge difference. They are an amazing family and we feel we had great friends to share this journey with 🧡
These two months with the kids has been a lifetime opportunity and I think we made the most of it, every second.
We are very happy to be at home, reunite with our friends and family, and breathe NZ.

We are going home 🧡
24 February 2024
If we thought it was a rollercoaster before, the last two weeks have been Six Flags + Disney and Universal Studios altogether.
Unfortunately there was a bad timing between the Gene therapy ""expiring"" and hospitals theatres. We are hoping the Lab can extend the shell life of the gene therapy and the hospital team is happy with it.
Once this happens, if it does, we can talk again with the team and hopefully we can come back for the second time, second eye, second chance.
We don't have dates for this, but let's Hope it's as soon as possible.
The first eye is recovering really well. The doctor is happy and we have noticed changes too. This is why we feel sad the second eye hasn't happened yet but we feel optimistic we can come back in April-May.
Our doctor has gone above and beyond. He has shown to be extremely professional, trusting and caring.
Also, we met the other family who is here for the same reason and I can say it has made a huge difference to be here with them. They are an amazing family and feel we have friends to share this journey with 🧡
These two months sharing 24/7 with the kids it's a lifetime opportunity and I think we made the most of it. Them and us have been growing lots with the experiences we had here in London.
We wish we could say we did what we came to do, but most importantly is that we still have chances to get it done.
Can't wait to see our friends and family in NZ and be at home. And recharge to come back 🤞💪🤞💪🤞💪🤞

(Continue) Some disappointing news
20 January 2024
This raised some questions about the surgery done two weeks ago. He is convinced and confident that when he did the procedure, if something had been wrong he would have noticed. But also it was thawed, diluted , filtered in less than 30 minutes(less time than labs tests)
At the moment there is no inflammation in Ciro's operated eye. And all signs are positive. But he will have to keep an eye on (lol) and monitor closely.
Next steps:
Reduce the steroids dose because it's unlikely there will be another surgery and side effects are not worse the wait.
Monitor closely the first eye
Wait for the Lab at least two weeks to se if they come up with solutions stabilizing the current Gene therapy (although if they find the way in doing this, it'd be the first time and haven't been tested before, so the doctor doesn't know if it is safe)
We went through a big rollercoaster of emotions. I guess now is sadness, but also reassuring that we want Ciro to be safe, that we've done everything in our reach.
We hope nothing happens to the first eye, we Hope the gene therapy worked (we will know within months), and we wonder if this is all happening for an unknown, bigger plan for Ciro (a bit holistic we know lol) and a huge learning curve for us.
Thanks again everyone for the support. We have been feeling that we are not alone in this, and THAT has made all the difference.
Kia haha 🧡❤️‍🩹

Some disappointing news
20 January 2024
After a fun but challenging fasting morning entertaining Ayla and Ciro we arrived at the hospital 1:30pm. We met the doctor and he was dressed in his regular clothes. First clue something wasn't right.
He told us that he couldn't perform the surgery because the gene therapy (the virus he injects in the aye that carries the modified DNA) didn't pass a test.
He explained that he wanted to book other families to come to London for the same treatment but because the expiring date of the gene therapy was end of Feb he needed check with the lab/pharmaceutical who created the gene therapy if this was possible. When they thawed and tested a vail a day before the surgery (17 Jan), after 30minutes the gene therapy started to show some solidified elements (which are not good for the eye and procedures.
After calling the doctor and expressing their concerns they tested 3 more vails. All of them did the same, hence, didn't pass the tests.
The doctor is very aversed to risk and he believed it wasn't safe to do the surgery because the high chances of thawing another vail and being bad. Putting this bad Gene therapy on Ciro's eye would have severe consequences, and a lot of them are theoretical... It has never happened before.
(Will continue on a different Post)

17 January 2024
In the lead up to the second surgery, Ciro behave like a champ today while doctors were studying his Brain response to images on the screen.
It's a lot for him to take in but he has been very smiley and happy all along.
He is enjoying we are all four here, and you can tell how much he takes from what each one of us has to give him in every single moment.
It has made a huge difference and the support we have received here has Ben incredible too.
A big shoilut out to Ronald McDonald house Evelina that have been spoiling in a very kind way Ayla and Ciro
And to out friends who have been here with us showing us around, helping us distractin, sharing moments and creating memories.

Thanks again everyone for your support, and sorry if we haven't been able to respond the messages. Every moment is full on with the two little ones. Lol

Right eye surgery went as expected
5 January 2024
The Dr just told as the surgery went as he expected.
He was very happy with the surgery and how things went :)
Ciro will be grumpy but he is recovering well
He was very happy before going to the theatre, just upset when it was ""time to sleep""
It was very funny and emotional to hear a team of 6 of the medical stuff singing old macdonald had a farm and Twinkle twinkle little star lol
Ciro cried
I cried
Then he was asleep
The o cried a little bit more
And then we went for breakfast and waited to hear the good news.
He is a real champ.
Thanks everyone for the support.
Surgery costs were a total of 33k NZD, so we couldn't be here without your support.
There is still a lot going on, but we are doing really well.
Thank you 🧡

Flights are booked, time to pack (we'll wave Santa in the sky)
16 December 2023
We want to share with everyone that they have confirmed surgery dates and now we are ready for the second stage..
It has been a very stressful last 10 days because they have said that the hospital is not going to cover their fees, so now we need to pay £5950 x2 and £2380 x2 (around 32k NZD)
But because of all the support we have received, from this page, the market, fundraisers, and other donations we were able to confirm we are capable to go and do this for Ciro.
It's going to be tight, let's hope everything goes well and there are no more surprises, and we should be ok.
But because everything is so uncertain we are going to keep the page open until the end February which is when it's meant all to be over.
We are off on Xmas day.
First surgery 4 January
Second surgery 18 January
There is still a lot to get done, but we are getting closer.
Thanks again everyone and we'll keep you posted
Lots of love

We worked really hard on the lead up with lots of support from chopping onions, to cutting paper, sorting efpost, cooking, baking, donating to even standing next to the stall sorting avivados o going to buy last minute buns.
THANK YOU everyone.
We sold everything!
And those who donated extra to your meals, or donated recently, Ciro and out family are stoked by the support and makes us stronger to keep working for this cause.

One more time we want to thank you for all your support!
Because we want to extend our fundraising journey off-line too, we are having a stall at the Latin Street Festival, 4 November from 3pm-8pm. We are going to be selling some mouthwatering South American food. We know it's not much, but this is a small token of giving something back and working extra hard for this cause.
Lots of friends and extended family have been helping us to make this possible: so a special shout-out to all of you!
We are on the move 💛

We'd like to share a bit more Ciro's story on how we found out he had LCA AIPL1 and what this surgery means to us. What involves making this decision and understand more how the surgery works.

I read the article. What a journey you have all been on. It actually reminds me a lot of my journey with my son who has 2 rare genetic conditions- one of them causing him to loose 80% of his vision within a year. I’m also in CHCH so if you ever want to chat to another Mum battling to keep their child’s vision- feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to provide my contact details. Hoping you guys reach your goal and that the trip will be as beneficial as hoped.

Gratitude: from Latin gratus ‘pleasing, thankful’.
5 October 2023
It's been a very emotional week in so many ways... Your donations and messages fill our hopes and hearts to keep working really hard to make this possible. Lots of love and beautiful messages from all over the world. They make us smile and cry in the most unpredictable times (after a tool box meeting in front of colleagues, or midmorning in the office with workmates, managers and CEO, ooops).
We wish we could give a big hug to everyone, the support is huge.
THANK YOU! Thank you for sharing, donating and been there for us.
💛🧡

Jackson is an incredible young man (14) who begrudgingly saw his GP for a stubborn cold in April, which escalated immediately to a transfer to chch and devastating diagnosis.
With their bathroom gutted, they urgently need our help to install a hygienic space for Jackson's comfort and well-being. Your donation will make a tangible difference in their daily lives as they focus on Jackson's health journey.
Together, we can bring comfort and relief to this brave family during this difficult time. As Jackson undergoes treatment, the family faces the burden of travel and living costs while being away from home and work.
Your contribution will alleviate the financial strain, allowing them to focus on Jackson's recovery and support their family without the worry of financial stress. Every donation counts in supporting this resilient family during their journey towards healing. As we all know, this family continuously make positive contributions to their communities and although they are reserved about asking for help, I know many of you are wanting to do your bit for them in their time of need.

8 May 2024
Amy, Jackson, Gracie, Summer and I would like to express our sincerest gratitude for what has been an overwhelming response of aroha and tautoko/support in light of Jackson’s diagnosis. From our whanau and friends, to acquaintances and members of the community and those further abroad supporting us through messages of love, offerings of Kai, transport, and donations of time and money has TRULY blown us away.
We are so proud of our son Jackson as he has been nothing but noble in the face of this life changing diagnosis and subsequent treatment plan. He asks questions of the doctors that mum and dad miss, he reads all the information provided by the doctors and he brings mum and dad down from spiralling at times with his sage advice, “dad we can’t look too far ahead and just take it one day at a time”. We are also very proud of our daughters Gracie and Summer who are holding down the fort at home while we are based in Christchurch.
As for Jackson, he has started his chemotherapy as of Monday and so far he has responded well. We have a long road ahead with many hurdles to overcome but with his positive attitude and the support of our whanau, friends and community we will overcome this.
Once again, thank you to everyone who has messaged, offered time and donations, those who have cooked kai for us and those who have prayed for Jackson, we are so grateful to you all ❤️
Arohanui to you all,

Kylie asks
Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

Upon further investigation, Freya was diagnosed in 2020 with Hypermobility Ehlers Danlos. This is a rare disability that affects the connective tissue in her body. Every body system can be affected. She is in constant pain and suffers extreme fatigue.
As a complication of hEDs, she has developed abdominal vascular compressions. These cause severe nausea, vomiting, pain, rapid weight loss and dehydration. Unfortunately, the NZ public health system does not recognise her condition. They treat her conservatively, and refer to her issues as psychosomatic. This couldn’t be further from the truth and, after two years of gastric issues, Freya has now lost her ability to eat relying on liquid supplements to meet her nutritional needs.
The lack of expertise in NZ has led to our search for alternative specialised treatment. We plan to go to Germany in September for further testing and life changing surgery. However, the cost for this care is a challenge ($140000 - $180000).
Hi, I'm Freya. I am 17 and in my final year of High School. The past two years make me feel as though my life has been taken away from me. All I want is to eat again. I want to play Saturday morning netball again and see my friends every day at school. I want my life back.

She no longer feels her previous leg and pelvic pain, or nausea on eating. Pain meds are gradually reducing too! Now begins rehabilitation with physio, oesteopath and gastroenterolgy appointments booked in the first couple of weeks. Thank you everyone who has helped Freya to 'get her life back'.

On two feet again!
15 September 2023
Day two post surgery and there were some big wins today. I was able to sit up unassisted and then stand up.
It was such a weird feeling to do something that was so simple four days ago and now requires a lot of energy!! But I did it and I feel a lot better having stood up and helped get that blood moving.
Bring on the next week!

Recovery begins
14 September 2023
With surgery now behind her, Freya's journey back to health begins. We would like to say a massive thank you to everyone who has donated, sent prayers and get well soon messages. Your kind words offer support, encouragement and much needed comfort. The surgeons, doctors and nurses who make this surgery possible are amazing. Everything went as expected and follow up scans towards the end of October will confirm success of the procedure. For now, we have a two week stay in hospital as Freya builds strength to walk and eat again. We'll keep you updated.

Diagnosis day.
6 September 2023
Today I had my scans in Leipzig with Professor Scholbach, I am very grateful for his expertise and he diagnosed me with the following:
Massive May Thurner syndrome, compression of the left iliac vein
Severe Pelvic Congestion Syndrome
Extreme Lordotic Curvature
Severe compression of the vena cava
MALS
SMAS
Disturbed duodenal peristalsis
Complete compression of left renal vein (Nutcracker)
4 collateral veins around the right iliac artery (you should only have one)
Possible Bornavirus (further testing needed)
It feels relieving to finally have some answers and someone believe my pain is real. He was shocked at how severe my pelvic congestion was and just the amount of blood pooling around my uterus. It was also reassuring to discover why I am unable to eat more than five pretzels or a few mouthfuls of food.
Now we wait for the 12th of September for my surgery! Feeling a little anxious but I am ready for this journey.

Off to Germany!
9 August 2023
Some final tests including a gastroscopy and colonoscopy done. A CTA scan was also sent off to Germany where the surgeon could finally give Freya a diagnosis. She has been diagnosed with MALS, SMAS, nutcracker syndrome and left ovarian vein dilation. However, more may be discovered with specialised scans in Germany. Her surgery is planned for the 12th of September and we fly out on the 2nd of September. Thank you to everyone who has helped on our journey.

Julius was suffering from a cough, low energy and having difficulty breathing. After 5 weeks of return visits to the GPs with no improvement, his parents took him to the Emergency Department where he was immediately flown to Starship. They found a huge mass in his chest and he was admitted to ICU, as he was unable to breath and it was touch and go for him. Julius' diagnosis is T cell Lymphoblastic lymphoma/Leukemia. He is amazingly positive and a real fighter so is responding well to Chemo. However, this will be a two year journey for him. Mum (Monique) works hard to support the family and was Northland Trade & Sales Rep for Resene. She has had to resign her position to care for Julius and as a result has lost her car and income. Although she is able to access some support, of course it is never enough. The family need to move from Okaihau to Kerikeri to be nearer services and need support for ongoing medical care, petrol costs and associated costs to get Julius back on his feet and playing rugby, and, of course, they need a car to get to medical appointments. I love this family, they are hard working, honest people respected by our community and need our support.

A huge thank you to everyone who donated and supported our Benefit Evening for Julius. We raised just over $4,200 and are so humbled by the great support shown by our community.
Julius struggled for a while to get his levels to a sufficient level that he could start his next round of treatment and had to spend time at Starship but he got there! He had his first round of this really important level of treatment and is now waiting for his levels to pick up a wee bit before he can go back down to Starship for his next treatment - we're keeping our fingers crossed that will happen towards the end of this week. These treatments are super important, and a bit harsh on his body, however Julius is so amazingly positive - he is an example to us all. He also made it to the cinema and spent some time with his bestie so great steps forward. Thank you again to our wonderful community for your support - it really does help in every way.

An Uphill Struggle & A Benefit Evening
27 October 2023
Hi everyone, Julius has had a tough few weeks with his next round of treatment being postponed mainly as his blood levels were too low, and some problems keeping his feed tube in. As a result he's been back in Starship, is having blood transfusions and they are getting him back on track. Great news is that the recent bone marrow biopsy showed that Julius is holding his own.
Tomorrow evening we are holding a Benefit Evening in Kerikeri for people to come along and Support Julius and his family - local businesses have been super generous in donating towards our auction and raffle and local band Soundloungers will be entertaining us, along with DJ Ian. The auction prizes are pretty much lovely items that are just a great treat and there is really something for everyone.
Bring cash too, and we are running the raffle at $5 a ticket and will be providing some Kai (cash only) as there will be a bar.

Benefit Evening for Julius & Update
26 September 2023
We are holding a benefit evening for Julius on 28th October, at the Kerikeri Sports Complex. This will consist of an Auction and local band The Soundloungers and DJ Ian will be providing us with some great music. Please do contact Claire on 021883616 or flashgordon.claire@gmail.com to donate an item or service the Auction - every cent counts!
In the meantime, here's an update - Julius has had a few setbacks with hospital admission for further treatment and several platelet & blood transfusions. Feeding tube has been taken out as a trial because currently Julius has some underlying stomach issues which means he is struggling to keep his daily medications down which can be up to 11 pills twice a day, and they are wanting to get that sorted, his appetite continues to be pretty non existent - however, overall he is still in good spirits and keeping strong.
Julius starts interim maintenance this week and if all counts are at a high enough level he will travel tomorrow to Auckland, with a huge treatment & theatre day planned following which he will be monitored for a minimum of 48hrs with discharge unknown.
This plan is in place for the next 4 fortnights and is all dependant on his nutrition counts..

It's a tough road
30 August 2023
Last week was a difficult one for Julius as all the chemo, treatments, travel etc caught up with him and his body decided food just wasn't on the cards. His weight and energy levels dropped as he couldn't take on nutrition so treatments and travel were cancelled for the week and he had a feeding tube to remind his brain that food really is a necessity! Good news is that he was able to go down to Starship on Monday and had a big day for treatments, so the feeding tube is doing it's job, and will continue to be needed for some weeks during his consolidation period. Back home now, and this week is another one with lots of treatments so a tough one for Julius. We are thankful to all your continued support and we would like to particularly thank Bald Angels who are sprinkling some angel dust and we are arranging some treats for Juiius and his family.

First head shave!
18 August 2023
Julius has remained stoical through his latest rounds of chemo and today was his first head shave. Not to be outdone by Julius his Gran and Uncle got their heads shaved too! This is one awesome family. We're working on pulling together the Benefit Concert and Auction - we are so thankful to have the NRC and Kerikeri Rugby Club supporting us with our fund raising efforts and to the aroha shown by our community. This is just the start of a pretty long journey for Julius so we need to keep the momentum going. Julius is currently classified as ""neutropenic"" - which basically means zero immunity so his bubble is being kept really tight. Big thanks to everyone who has donated, we're moving nicely towards our goal so please do donate if you haven't already done so and share, share, share the link.

Julius is home!
11 August 2023
Julius has had a tough week, his first blood transfusion and multiple chemo treatments. However, true to form he has kept positive and his reward has been to come home today!
We are so delighted that both Northland Rugby Union and Julius’s own Club, Kerikeri, have come on board to support us. Thanks also to NZ Herald Kaupapa Maori Editor Joseph Los’e who did a great article for the whanau.
Our Give-A-Little page is gradually working its way towards our target and we are so thankful to everyone who has donated.
We’re still working on getting a Benefit Concert together - hopefully in November, and an Auction. Please contact Claire on 021883616 if you have anything you would like to donate to the auction, all the proceeds are going towards getting Julius back on his feet and on that rugby field.

Julius - a true warrior
3 August 2023
During the past 10 days Julius tested positive for Covid, but has managed it well and is currently having round of chemo. He stays amazingly positive throughout, and is showing real strength of character and definitely has not lost his sense of humour! His immediate goal is to be well enough to come home next Friday and to continue his treatments and appointments from home, travelling to Whangarei and Auckland (which in itself will be a challenge, and pretty draining). He misses his whanau and friends so is super keen to get home, so let's keep our fingers crossed that he isn't thrown another curve ball before next Friday! In the meantime, everyone's support is really appreciated and we're a third of the way to meeting our goal, so please share share share and let's get Julius back on track.

My goal is to stay alive and I remain hopeful. For this immunotherapy, I will have to leave the country. The flights, accommodation and therapy are very expensive. We hope that with your help we can achieve this and beat cancer once and for all.”

Hello everyone ,
The past 2-3 weeks have been filled with daily 3-4 hour clinic visits for various treatments besides the immunotherapy and the doctor and his team are truly amazing. All treatments have no side effects I feel improvement in my energy levels.
The warm and beautiful weather here makes my stay easier as I can do the daily clinic visits by bike.
The results of the blood test I had on the day of my arrival were as expected- not so good. My tumour marker had increased from the last test, and it proved that it was the right decision to act so quickly. We did a second blood test last Monday, and the results were absolutely incredible. It showed that in only 2 weeks, all values had improved and were in the normal range. My tumour marker decreased by 2.5 points! We were thrilled and so happy and couldn't believe it at first.
Of course, the tumour is still present, and the plan is to undergo another full week of treatment. But it indicates that I am responding well, which gives me more hope.
I am so grateful. None of this would have been possible without your generous donations, your support and love from everywhere in the world. Thank you so much for all your continuous support. This journey has been exceptional, and I am truly grateful beyond words.
Dōmo arigatō 🙏 and lots of aroha

Posted by: Sven Intemann
We can’t believe it, but we made it to Japan and are slowly settling in. I've already had my first face-to-face consultation with the specialists, and the wonderful team has decided on the best treatment plan for me. I feel really positive and in good hands. I've already started my treatment, and I have to go to the clinic every day for a few hours over the next 4 weeks. In approximately 2 weeks, I will have another blood test, which will show the first indications of how the treatment is progressing.
So many things have happened over the last few weeks, and everything has happened so fast. I'm so thankful that I could come and make a start, as my last MRI showed an increase in the tumour.
Thank you again for your continuing support, your generosity, all the wonderful positive and encouraging words, the truly amazing movie fundraiser and art auction and thank you for believing in my mission. 🙏 This wouldn't be possible without you.
Sending lots of aroha

Kylie asks
Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

As some of you already know, I recently received a life-altering diagnosis: Stage 4 Squamous Cell Carcinoma in my larynx and thyroid. At 26 years old, I'm preparing for a total Laryngectomy, involving the removal of my voice box & thyroid, resulting in a permanent stoma (hole in my neck) & speaking valve. After surgery, my battle continues with radiation therapy & chemotherapy.
Besides the emotional toll this has taken on me, my family & friends, there are financial challenges too. While most medical costs are covered, unforeseen expenses have emerged.
Fertility preservation is vital but only partially funded.
My immune system has been heavily impacted by the steroids I was put on for the last 6 months.
Dietary changes & supplements are essential to prepare for (and recover from) surgery, among other costs like potentially a chemotherapy hat to prevent my hair falling out & help to cover transportation.
Currently, I rely on a limited medical benefit. It covers essentials like rent, power, & some groceries, but falls short for these other expenses.
I rarely ask for help, but if you are in a position to donate, it would mean the world to me. Your support will ease these unexpected costs & help me prepare for surgery and recovery, giving me a chance to reclaim my life.
Thank you for reading my story & supporting me through these challenging times. Your generosity, regardless of size, will profoundly impact my life.
With much appreciation,
Savannah

I would like to thank Emily from Plazmart NZ for her kindness, checking up on me and for sharing my Give A Little page. We got donations from complete strangers. Thank you ❤️
I would like to thank Anna from My Will Wishes for reaching out to me. It was because of one of you purchasing her book via me that she found out about me talking about the book.
If you would like to purchase the My Will Wishes book please go to the website https://www.mywillwishes.com & use the discount code being “Kendall” to get $5 off per book. This kind thoughtful gesture from Anna has also created a lot of tears 😭 Thank you to everyone that has purchased.
I’ve had a few people contact about medications. The unfunded drugs I am currently taking is called Dabrafenib with trametinib. It was listed as part of the 13 drugs that the Government promised to fund. However as at Monday the 24th of June 2024 my unfunded drugs it didn’t make the cut. There will be 7 drugs that will get funding from October/November this year.
As for the remaining 6 drugs, they will be replaced by alternatives ""just as good or better"" and will be phased in over the next year. This is where my unfunded drugs fit in. I would still need to fund the unfunded drugs until the new phased drugs come into place. This could be up to 1 year period for an example.

June 2024 update
21 June 2024
Posted by: Kendall Takuta
We have met with my oncologist on the Wednesday the 19th June to discuss the results of the MRI scan of the brain. The results are: My spots in my brain are SHRINKING! There was one spot for an example that was 20mm which has reduced in size to 13mm! There are other spots shrinking!
Treatment plan is to continue the unfunded treatment, continue the scans while managing the side effects. Yet to do a CT scan for body to see if it’s working.
If allowed to stay on this unfunded treatment for as long as we can pay for it. Thank you for every donation. The unfunded medications that I am taking is currently on the list of cancer drugs that the Government are to fund.
The unfunded treatment that I am on 5 daily oral tablets. If side effects start I am to stop the medication. This is protocol. Side effects could fevers, to skin changes, to headaches, to nausea & more. I may need to seek medical attention/ urgent treatment.
I have been experiencing side effects since starting mainly fevers and skin changes. Ive also developed a cough. I’m on antibiotics to help with that.
Can you believe it’s almost been 1 year since my brain 🧠 surgery~ Woah what a year it has been!
Truly thank you for the messages, the love, the laughs, the prayers/positive vibes/thoughts, the support, the gifts, the fundraising efforts, the donations, the prepared meals, the visits & more.

Not an update but still very important- thank you
12 June 2024
Hello.Not an update but something very important. It’s a subject we never really talk about. I’d like to tell you about a book about your wishes after you have passed away.
The book is called “My Will Wishes”. It’s written by a fellow Kiwi author. I am telling everyone about this book because I believe in this book and due to my current health situation. If you know me well — you will know I’m a planner 🙂 but we all should be prepared.
This book is super personalised as you answer and complete it yourself so it’s in your own handwriting and your thoughts/requests ❤️ By doing this doesn’t leave your family or friends wondering what you wanted or doubting themselves.
This book asks you questions about what you would like. It is super hard to complete this book as it is confronting and asks some questions that I myself have never ever thought about.
Some of the questions you will ponder on for a few days. It seriously gets you thinking about what you would like when you do pass away.
From funeral requests, to carrying on family tradition’s, to your belongings, to your pets and the list countiues on.
A few people I have already mentioned this book to have already purchased this book and given some to their family members.
I’ll post the website along below with a discount code of SHOP2024 if you would like $5 off per book. Reminder there are shipping costs. Thank you. I am not sponsored just want to share the knowledge and help others ❤️

Hello. We’ve had a few people asking what is happening concerning my treatment plan. In April I started taking unfunded medication ($4k-$7k NZD per month). I am extremely fortunate to be able to do this option. Thank you again to everyone that has made this possible.
The plan is to do two months worth of unfunded medication before a scan. The scan will determine if the unfunded treatment if it’s working or not!
With any medication there are side effects. I have been experiencing tiredness, fevers & skin changes. In early May I was admitted to hospital overnight. I was experiencing high fevers, coughing, vomiting and voice changes.
I had to stop the treatment while I was in hospital. Done a chest x-ray which the results showed I had pneumonia. A course of antibiotics and on the mend.
Don’t be scared to reach out to either of us. We have a few people say that they have wanted to message us but they haven’t. Mainly the reason is because they don’t want to bombard us or they know that others will be messaging us so they don’t want to burden us.
Apologies to those who may of seen this update already!
Yet again thank you for the messages, the love, the laughs, the prayers/positive vibes/thoughts, the support, the gifts, all of the fundraising efforts, the donations, the prepared meals, the visits & etc.
We truly thank you and are appreciative of everything! No words can truly express how truly thankful! From the bottom of our hearts.

March update - get the tissues ready! Seriously!
6 April 2024
Posted by: Kendall Takuta
Hi. I won’t give up the fight- I’m continuing to fight! For more in depth update please refer to my FB page.
New spots of cancer have been found in my brain and tailbone.
Treatment options: whole head radiation or unfunded treatment. Also been kicked off the funded treatment.
Prognosis: Get the tissues ready now. I’ve been told unfortunately that I’ve only got months to live. Yes months. Not a year. Months.
Leaving work: It’s been a hard decision but I’ve also resigned from work as most of you are aware.I will miss my work whanau of 9 years.
Support: For those that what to help support you can do so by donating below. If you prefer my bank account - please refer to my FB. We are unsure what other support we need/require at this moment.
Shock: Please note that it’s only been under 1 week since we received this news. We are still in shock as I believe you will be as well reading this update. It’s very devastating news.
Easter Sunday Admission: I was admitted to hospital on Easter Sunday and discharged yesterday Friday 5th April. I was admitted due to severe back pain and vomiting I am experiencing. I think with the shock of the news my body reacted this way. I then completed a MRI scan for my back. They are unable to determine what is causing the severe back pain or the vomiting but know that I’m medicated for both.
Thank you: A continued thank you for everything you guys have done so far ! I! ❤️

Hey everyone :) In early February 2024 we met with my oncologist. The current plan is to stay on my current treatment as my body spots are either stable or shrinking! Yay!
For my brain 🧠 we will be starting Radiation in the near distant future. I have not had Radiation up to this point. Awaiting an appointment with Radiology - hopefully soon. Unknown if it’s a possible treatment option yet.
Side note- I’ve already had my whole head radiation mask ☢️ 😷 made so that’s a head start (yes it’s a pun- thanks Jack for noticing). That’s the current plan of attack at this stage - but it still could change at any moment.
- Can you believe it’s coming up to 31 weeks since my brain 🧠 tumour surgery ?
- Also the middle of this month we are coming up to the 1 year mark of when I was told that I’m stage 4 Melanoma cancer. What a year!
Apologises to those lucky ones that will see or have seen this message twice or even three times.
I’m on repeat again but guys we truly are very appreciative of it. Thank you for the messages, the love, the hugs, the laughs & the tears, the prayers/good positive vibes/thoughts, the support, the care, the understanding, the gifts and cards, all of the fundraising efforts, the donations, the meals/food, offers of babysitting & the list continues.

Can you believe that it’s been 4 months since brain surgery! It’s almost been a whole year since I was diagnosed Stage 4 Melanoma Cancer (January 2023).
Brain area:
Earlier this month I had an MRI scan to check what is going on with my brain since my surgery.
- No major changes. Yay!!!
- There have been minimal changes. Those changes are that there are some small minor spots across my brain have appeared. I will continue to have close monitoring/regular MRI scans.
- No change in size of the Melanoma tumour on the left side of my brain.
For the rest of my body:
I am continuing with Immunotherapy to keep fighting the other Melanoma cancer cells located across my body.
Awaiting my next CT scan to see how we are going. Fingers crossed we are continuing to beat it! I’ll update when the results are in.

Hello. I am recovering well and if you saw me in person you wouldn’t even know that I’ve had brain surgery over 7 weeks ago. I will continue with treatment I am on as it continues to work. On Monday I got results of my recent CT scan. I am stable and the tumours in my body are continuing to shrink!!! Yay! We hope and pray that they continue to do so! I won’t be doing radiation at this point in time due to: 1. The tumour on my left side of my brain is too small for radiation. 2. The area on my right side of my brain where the neurosurgeons removed the bleeding tumours is too big due to removing a lot of brain tissue due to the bleeding. It’s left a huge cavity in my brain. 3. It is also super close to my optical nerve (my vision). I will be in having ongoing MRI scans to watch these areas. Because of the brain surgery I am not able to drive for a whole year. This could be reviewed at 6 months. Because of the surgery I am at risk of having a seizure at any time and anywhere. This week I’ve started back at work part time hours. I am loving being back. Thank you yet again for the continuing support, prayers, positive thoughts, aroha, understanding, patience, friendship, messages, the fundraising efforts across the nation across from different organisations, the planned / surprise visits, food/baking, flowers, the gifts and cards, sharing of the give a little page and the donations.

Awaiting Brain Surgery :(
9 July 2023
GET THE TISSUES READY…
Hi Everyone,
For all of those who don’t know, my big sister, Kendall, is in hospital awaiting brain surgery. She was diagnosed with Stage 4 Melanoma cancer earlier this year.
Unfortunately, she was rushed to hospital on Thursday morning after suffering blurred & double vision and nonstop vomiting.
After a few tests, a CT and MRI scan, we can confirm that she has melanoma tumours in her brain. Two of them are bleeding, causing pressure within her skull.
To relieve this pressure, her oncology team and neurologists have suggested that removing these tumours will be the best treatment option for her. The third tumour will be treated with radiation or chemotherapy- this is waiting to be determined.
She will be having brain surgery tomorrow afternoon. As expected, with a surgery as serious as this is, there are some life changing risks and an unknown recovery period. Due to this, we are asking for any donations (big or small) to please be put towards their give a little page (I’ll pop the link in below). Any money donated will be used for mortgage repayments, fuel, food etc to help the family through this already tough time.
I will do an updated post tomorrow evening after her surgery.
Please continue to pray, show support and send your love to her, JH, the kids & our extended whanau. Please avoid messaging Kendall & John-Henry at this time… she will read your comments below 🙂 ❤️

June 2023 update. Thank you everyone.
2 July 2023
Posted by: Kendall Takuta
Hello everyone,
We hope you and your whanau are all well. Recently we have met with the Oncology team. The positive news: The treatment is working well. There are some side affects being tiredness and nausea.
Some of the smaller cancer spots in my body have completely disappeared. None of the cancer spots have grown. No new spots. Some cancer spots have become thicker - which can happen when on treatment. Most of the cancer spot tumours have either stopped growing or have become smaller! Exactly the news we wanted to hear!!!!
I was advised that the fractured rib I have is also healing. We didn’t even know I had a fractured rib! This was definitely news to us and a shock honestly!
The treatment plan is to continue with the Immunotherapy infusions and have regular CT scans to check how the cancers are reacting to it all.
Once again we truly appreciate all the prayers, the support, the checking in, the thoughts, the gifts for the kids, the gifts for us, the fundraising efforts, the chats and the messages, the positive vibes/thoughts, the gift cards, the donations, the food, the kindness, the understanding, the continued friendship and for continuing to treating us like normal!
I know that we keep saying it but we truly mean what we say that no words can truly express what this has meant to us! Believe us this has been all overwhelming! But truly know that we are truly thankful for all of it!
Thank you so much.
On behalf John-Henry, myself and our children.

Hi everyone,
Firstly we would like to thank everyone for their support, kind words, gifts, donations and prayers for us during this time. It truly is overwhelming and truly appreciated beyond words.
Kendall has had her first dose of treatment. She has suffered some minimal side affects but is pushing through it as well as she can.
In the next couple of months Kendall will receive her second dose of treatment. We will then find out sometime after if the treatment is working or if we need to stop to go onto a unfunded treatment. Will try to keep this page updated as best as we can. Thank you to everyone.

Help Emma recover from breast cancer 🙏,To raise funds to support Emma's cancer treatment which is not funded in NZ.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/10443569-28a3-4e08-9562-b0e100e806b5-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/help-emma-recover-from-breast-cancer,20350.0,70000.0,172 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/help-emma-recover-from-breast-cancer,23 Dec 2023,23 Dec 2024,0,"Palmerston North, Manawatu-Wanganui",184,"—
In September 2023, my younger sister Emma at just 28 years old, was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. The type of breast cancer she has is called HER2-positive, one of the more aggressive/rapidly growing types and has a higher risk of recurrence. After already going through fertility preservation (IVF), genetic testing and 4 chemotherapy sessions, she still has a long year ahead with more chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and immunotherapy.
Unfortunately one of the 4 drugs used for her treatment, Pertuzumab, isn’t funded in New Zealand, like it is overseas in Australia, despite being proven effective.
Pertuzumab reduces the chance of recurrence, and also protects her heart from the side effects from the other drugs used in her treatment.
Currently Emma and her partner Rayo are struggling to pay the high cost of the $7,194 every 3 weeks for the drug Pertuzumab, which is normally taken for a full year.
I’m hoping to raise funds to required to continue funding her life saving treatment.
No one should ever have to go through this terrifying experience, and especially at such a young age with so much life ahead of her.
I'm not usually one to ask for help but in a situation completely out of our control any help would be greatly appreciated ❤️
If you can spare anything, I am forever grateful for your love and support.

Previously on Emma's cancer journey, I had a revision surgery and that went super well. Even managed to get back into some aerials pretty quick after!
Since then I started and finished radiation, which for me (besides going to the hospital every day) wasn't too bad though side effects could occur really anytime.
Really the only thing that is left for me now is to finish up my last five immunotherapy infusions and hopefully my body thinks this will be the last of cancer for me.
Thank you everyone for all of your support. I still have a ways to go to heal from this ongoing experience, but will likely be a very sparse poster (sorry about that).
Wishing you all the best,
Emma

Onto the next phase!
19 March 2024
Posted by: Emma Robertson
Hey everyone!
If you remember my last post I said something about PCR (pathological complete response) being the best outcome from surgery, well I got it! The chemo did the thing and killed the tumour! There was a smaller and different one in the tumour bed which was excised in full as well so technically I am cancer free! Unfortunately, the margins (section of healthy tissue around the excised site of this other tumour) was inferior in places so they do have to go in again and remove 1mm of tissue in those areas. If you don’t understand, totally cool it is hard to grasp parts of the treatment. This additional surgery is more or less an extra step to make sure cancer won’t come back. All of the next steps are working in this favour.
I still have a ways to go before I am done with being a regular at the hospital. One surgery (this Thursday), nine more immunotherapy infusions and a course of yet to be determined radiation ☢️
I am so grateful for everyone who has supported my partner, my family and me. It means the world.
But this post I get to say I am cancer free, which is amazing.
Bit of a throw back to before treatment started.

A lil' update
16 February 2024
Posted by: Emma Robertson
Hey everyone thank you all for your support we treasure it so much. There are no words to express the love I have for everyone who has donated or reached out.
In terms of where I am at, well I had surgery on Monday. Everything is healing well I think, though I do miss being able to use my right arm for everything.
We have a short waiting game, about three weeks, until we find out how effective chemo was. Radiologically, the MRI showed some great results and we are hopeful the pathology shows the same response.
That is all for now, I will update again in a few weeks.
All the love,
Emma

Moving on to phase two of treatment!
15 January 2024
Posted by: Emma Robertson
Thank you to everyone who has donated, it means the world to us to have support from so many of our friends and family. I don’t think I can thank anyone enough.
Today is my (hopefully) my final day of TCHP chemo, and I am very excited to say goodbye to docetaxel and carboplatin. While I am grateful they appear to have decimated my tumour, saying goodbye to the fatigue and other side effects is very welcome. I cannot wait to try get back into all things aerial as soon as I can!
The next steps after this will be surgery in February. Hopefully the findings from this will be a pathological complete response (PCR) which means I can just go on with the immunotherapy every three weeks until October bringing me to the end of the year long treatment.
Sorry to all the people I haven’t responded to yet, I will get back to all you soon!

Ten minutes later he was on the floor with no sensation from his waist down.
Quick thinking from the team in ED, PN Hospital meant he was put on the correct treatment and the diagnosis was confirmed as MOGAD - Transverse Myelitis. His neurologists & nurses have been incredible!
The messages from his brain to his lower body were not getting through due to inflammation in his spinal cord. This was caused by an unknown virus.
Jackson has been in Palmerston North Hospital for nearly a month, he is making great progress. He is a pro in the wheelchair and is enjoying his physio sessions. We are proud of his amazing attitude towards all of this (and there has been many emotional days too).
To be a healthy 17yo, who just gained NCEA level 2, left school in 2023 and was already two weeks into his first full time job, then this all happened! It is a lot to take in.
The prognosis is that it could be months/a year to get back to full mobility, with the chance of relapses. They have him on immunoglobin therapy and steriods to try to stop any reoccurrence.
The plan is for Jackson to head down to Burwood Hospital with his father Rob for extensive & specialized health care.
Jacksons care is covered by Te Whatu Ora but the costs with Rob in ChCh will add up, incl. accomodation. Rob needs to take annual leave (which he hasn't got any) so we are unsure if he will be paid. Tracy will be working , while at home with Jacksons siblings.

Kia ora all,
Jackson has been home a month now and adapting to being in a chair very well.
Physio has started back up again, and also some extra physio at home which the whole family takes part in.
Jackson is still dependant for the wheelchair, but has attempted crutches in physio. He cannot weight bare on his legs, the splints help with that, but he is gaining more muscle feeling back and can now see all his hard work is really really paying off. His aim is to be on crutches within the next few months.
We have been fortunate to meet another TM whanau, and they have given us a look into the future, and Jackson is excited! It is great to see that opportunities present and silver linings appear during this journeys that no one expected.
Our wonderful friends and community did an incredible job with organising a quiz night fundraiser, we are so so thankful for all our whanau and friends coming together not only on that night, but every other time to really boost our spirits and ‘walk’ alongside Jackson during everything.
Thanks again everyone! We love you all xoxo

Week 19 update
10 June 2024
Wow! How have we all got to 19 weeks? That’s getting close to half the year gone!
Jackson is doing incredibly well, been at home just over two weeks now and has really impressed all with his independance. We are so forever grateful that our young man has been so positive throughout this whole ordeal. Nothing is too much for him and his humour n cheekiness is really putting everyone at ease.
Some one sent us a message the other day to say that Jackson was just the same person but just with wheels. We are so proud of him and his attitude, he could have been so much angrier and really bitter about the situation. Do forgive us if we start with the ‘wheelie’ or ‘standing’ jokes, coping mechanism i guess. Jackson normally is quick off the mark with wit about his situation.
Today we saw the Neurologist who has been monitoring him since this all began. She is hugely impressed with his mobility and how far he has come.
Plan? Two more years of treatment, ivIG transfusions monthly, steroids, blood thinners. Possible surgery for a port to help with accessing his dodgy veins.
Thought of a spinal stroke has been internationally debated with his condition. Still pointing more in favour with Transverse Myelitis.
Results from Oxford (UK) came back negative for anything further. I suppose we might never know why?
We want to say a big thank you from Team Torok for all the love and support. The aroha shown has really got Jackson and us through the thick and thin of it all. Massive Thanks!

I am so happy that you have Jackson home and follow with interest his road back to recovery. Jackson, can I just say what an amazing and resilient spirit you have. You have made it possible for your family to look ahead down the road with somewhere to go, not back! I am looking forward to the day when we get a phonecall from you saying you are ready to come back to work. Tracey and Rob, Jackson got lucky with you two, parenting 101 right there!

Week 14, It has been 4 months
28 May 2024
Yesterday marked 4 months since this journey began.
Jackson is now home!!! A warm and hilarious welcome home at the airport then a Team Torok Dinner. So appreciative of having all 5 Toroks under the same roof again. Fills the heart!
Jackson is settling in to the comforts of home well. He has admitted he missed our German Shepherd the most.
It has been a flurry of appointments already this week. Physio, Occupational Therapy, carers and supports, Mana whaikaha, GP appointments. Taking each appointment as needed and navigating the space at that time.
Getting Jackson out and about is more tricky than what we thought. Our car did not fit the wheelchair (even when the chair was pulled apart), so we traded the car for one that’s more practical. Our car dealer was incredible and we found a car perfect to our needs. Even with our extremely limited budget!
Adaptions to the bathroom were more outrageous but have DYI’d it till renovations can start. We were totally unaware how much bathrooms cost! Renovations can now be ok’d thank you to this GIve A little Page (MOH would have been at least 6 months away and there was so so much red tape!)
Big thank you to everyone!
Jackson is so happy to be home, he is comfy and enjoying the couch and his own bed!
We are enjoying having him home and it feels strange that he hasn’t been here for 4 months… but yet it feels the same, just with way more therapy equipment up the hallway and also him saying hello from his wheelchair zooming past our hallway.

Week 17 - Almost home!
22 May 2024
Team Torok has been blown away by the response of the Give A Little Page. It has really saved us in finding even more $$ to get Jackson home and in the house that he feels mobility safe in.
The page and everyone’s generosity from family, friends and community has been incredible!
The love and support for our Jackson has been beautifully received and sends such a warmth sense of love and strength behind us.
Jackson has one more sleep then he is home!
Walking is going well. Using the high walker and taking massive strides, sometimes the brain sends messages quicker than the legs can do but he balances himself well and continues like a champ.
We have had a ramp installed at home and a concrete pad so Jackson has access from driveway and letterbox to the deck/into the kitchen. Our dog is scared of the ramp!
We have had some quotes for the bathroom renovations. We aren’t able to do a full Reno but have been looked after by a local business who has provided us with an alternative option to get the costs down. We are so grateful for the donations and kindness so that these renovations will allow Jackson to be even more independent with his own cares.
It has been 17w since this all happened. We are so eager to get Jackson home and to have team Torok under the same roof. One more sleep to go!
Thanks again everyone, we honestly would not of been able to get Jackson home to a mobility friendly house without you all.

Hi Jackson
So pleased to hear the news about you heading home. Well done and all the best, Gavin and Helen
Week 13 & 14.
4 May 2024
We are truely grateful and immensely appreciative of the response to Let’s Get Jackson Walking Again Give a Little page and all the aroha and donations. The response has been incredible and we thank everyone!
Jackson has started the Transitional Rehab programme. This has given him the confidence to go shopping, plan a rostered meal, cook for others in the Spinal Hostel. Spag Bol was on the menu :)
Jackson and Rob have been out with OT who are teaching Jackson how to be independent in his wheelchair when in public places. This included trips to the beach, and how to get himself out of being stuck in the sand etc. A few trips into town and also to a wheelchair factory made it a pretty busy week.
Three more weeks and he should be home.
Due to the generosity of this page and also Robs & Jacksons work, we have been able to have Rob stay down in ChCh to be Jacksons support whilst I (Mum) are up here in PN working and being with S & A. It probably means that i wont be back to ChCh, however am very excited that my boy (and husband) will be home in no time.
Big thanks again everyone. The money donated will allow us to do some much needed renovations to our house so that Jackson can still be independent with his cares (like showering etc) and also once we both return back to work then we know that he is safe in his own home.
Our young man is incredible and he is getting better each day! Literally, one step at a time :)

My mother has transverse myelitis and we would be very happy to talk to you (parents) about our journey if that would be helpful.
Week 12, 1 month till Jackson could be home!
23 April 2024
Jackson is now settled into the Spinal Hostel at Burwood. Will be starting the 4 week program to transition into a home environment and community confidence by the end of this week.
Meeting with Drs 10d ago allowed us to talk further about getting home. The Drs have consulted with Neuro team in PN and the ivIG transfusions will continue for another couple of months. The team fought hard for Jackson for this valuable blood product and we are grateful. It’s just under 5 weeks till Jackson may get home.
Home is looking like a hospital storage room with a loan wheelchair (till he can get his suited one), commode, shower chair and various other gears to help him do daily tasks more independently.
Jackson has been doing driving lessons in a modified car and is acing it (and getting to see parts of ChCh that he hasn’t been able to access whilst living in a hospital).
We are looking into modifying the bathroom as what the OT has suggested is not going to work with the space we have. We get very minimal funding from MOH and it will not cover much of the bathroom adaptions. It’s pretty much on our own wallet.
Thank you for the support and love so far. It’s exciting and scary for Jackson and Team Torok to get him home, but the journey to recovery will not end when he gets home and we will do our best to accomodate his home to be suitable for his needs. Jackson is so incredibly determined, brave, and fabulously cheeky. We are so proud of him. SO PROUD!

Week 11
16 April 2024
Jackson has started to walk without the 'Jolly jumper'.... Huge progress and managed 60ish metres doing this!
Catheter bag is out, in TR getting ready to go on the programme to help transition home. We are week 11 and have approx 5 weeks left in ChCh.
So much has happened in the past week but Jacksons intune with his body and allowing rest to recoop, rest to heal and to allow the emotions to surface and process.
It's not easy on our Jackson, however we are super proud of this son of ours and are honoured to be here with him and celebrating the highs and unconditional love for the lows.
The Give a little page is still active. We don't get funding like ACC would allow as we don't qualify for ACC. The insurance company hasn't budged, ACC not there as it's a medical event. Social development can't help as Jackson only 17 and lives at home (social worker is trying really hard to navigate this!).... And we are now on one wage. We are so appreciative of everyone's generosity as we make Jackson our #1 priority here in ChCh and S&A our priority in palmy.
Thanks everyone, thank you for your incredible support.

Week 10
7 April 2024
Jackson is doing well at Burwood. Has had his brother and sister visit for the weekend and Rob and Tracy have done the parent swap for another two weeks.
Discharge date is mid-May but only if his function tests pass and also if he is more stable on his feet.
Tests for reflexes, bladder function and big team meeting this week to look ahead for the next month. Hoping in 2-3w time he will be in transitional rehab then will be 4w there.
Have had OT in at home to assess ramps, bed transfers, shower fittings, etc.. bit of an eye opener to what’s going to be the normality of Jackson being at home.
He is keen to head home but very nervous as it’s very different to prior coming into hospital. Will take each day as it comes. Thanks for all the messages and love. We really do appreciate everything that is being sent our way xxx

Best news!
28 March 2024
After two months since transverse myelitis entered into Jackson’s life… he got the best news! The inflammation of his myelin\spine is decreasing.
This is from his medical treatment and his incredible perseverance and determination.
So good to hear this news, knowing that treatment is working and that his condition hasn’t got any worse. This boy will be moving full steam ahead.
Expected discharge date home will be by Kings Birthday weekend.
Thanks again to everyone. Your aroha and donations are helping immensely as Rob and I take turns to be with Jack and see his improvement first hand!
We are so grateful to all the wonderful people who have donated, bless you all.

Extension to discharge date
25 March 2024
8w update. Yesterday was a pretty good day. X2 extensive physio sessions and OT support for transferring from chair to couches.
The health team forJackson at Burwood made the decision to push his discharge date to mid-June, an extra month.
The Drs who started the investigation with Jacksons health ph Burwood &advised the test that were sent overseas has come back as negative to MOGAD. Jackson will still be treated as transverse Myelitis. More CT and MRI scans to also tsee further markers of the disease and how it’s responding to treatment over the last 8 weeks. His full assessment has been sent to Oxford in the UK for in-depth analysis.
Jackson has been fitted with a cool new wheelchair, and he is learning even more wheelies in this. The wheelchairs name is Jenny, since Jacksons nickname is Forrest.
Wheelchair bball came to Jackson’s gym session and got him in a specifically designed wheelchair to play on the court. Jack made it look easy.
Jack feels a bit numb with all the changes but he is also very grateful where the progress has been made in the last 8 weeks.
After my next visit then we will talk about leaving Jackson down here for during the week and then flying down for the weekend to keep him company. It’s the only way with being on one wage.
Thank you to everyone, it has shown us even more that friends, family and community are incredible.
The insurance company is still not budging. Claim declined. No ACC funding.
Jacksons attitude and determination is contagious!

When family comes first but the insurance company is being difficult.
18 March 2024
7w 2d
nearly a month since Jackson was sent from PNH to Burwood.
Physio helps strengthen with his leg muscles. The knee's give-way & cannot weight bare. His ankle has ‘drop foot’ which is not ideal. Every day is small progress which makes big difference in overall recovery. Some days have been quite weary, and others are emotional, but Jackson gives it 110%.
it’s parent swap with Rob this weekend. At the end of this stay we will have no leave between us, we thank you for the koha that may allow us to keep being with Jackson.
We have life insurance with a Childhood Trauma clause, we out a claim in. It got declined 😞.insurance said they want to wait & see if Jack improves in 6m before paying any $$ out. This is gutting as it’s now that we need financial support as living two different islands and two different “lives” for Rob and I. Jackson also doesn’t qualify for benefits as he is under 18, wasn’t in employment for a period of time, comes from a stable home and none of it is under ACC.
The plan for now is to have a Rob or I by Jack whilst he’s inpatient, once he is in transitional care, then we will work during the week, fly back on the weekends to spend it with Jacko.
We have also made the decision not to bring S & A to ChCh (yet) as the $$ for AirNZ are ridiculous and will cost near $800 for 2 return flights.
Our unit is paid by the DHB & for the flights that rob and I make.
Jackson Torok’s optimism and massively positive attitude is helping all of us
Love Team Torok

Week 6
12 March 2024
Kia ora all. Thank you for all the messages, koha and aroha. Jackson is enjoying reading everyone’s notes with the donations and he is appreciating the Dad Jokes being sent.
The past week saw him fighting an infection, however today he is back in his wheelchair and showing his mama around Burwood. It is a massive place, so many wards and so many wonderful opportunities to get Jackson back to physical health.
The dog therapy arrived yesterday. Jackson realised how much he missing the animals back home. But Pip, the St Bernard was happy to give him attention…. Man that dog can dribble!
Rob has returned back home. We are calling ourselves the “South Island” and “north island” parent… which ever place we are at.
Jacksons pressure sores on his feet have heeled (these happened in the first week at PN hospital) so there is less risk of infection now.
Fingers crossed that he gets back into physio tomorrow after a week of bed rest.
We are so incredible proud of Jackson and the positive (and cheeky) attitude he has. He really has some amazing friends here and there is always a big hi to him from everyone here. (He is a self confessed celebrity in HG wing xxx)
Thanks everyone. Lots of love, Team Torok

Jack you will want to take Pip home. Great to hear infections are now healed. You have got this love. Your upper arms are going to beat dads.
There is a date in sight!
6 March 2024
Good news! Loving being able to Zoom into the medical meeting so i can see Jack and Rob and all of Jacksons amazing medical team and support in Burwood.
They are thinking that Jackson will be in Burwood medical wing for another 5 weeks, this will allow him to complete the 3 month course of immunoglobin therapy and steroids.
When Jackson is fit enough to and not needing as much medical intervention then he will be placed in transitional care. Kinda like a flatting situation but in Burwood grounds. This will allow Jackson to learn and continue to care for himself whether that be as he gains strength to walk again or if a wheelchair is still needed.
Once he can master this then he can come home and adaptions to the house will be assessed etc. Let’s bring on May!!!
Big thank you to everyone for the aroha and support. We appreciate you all so much!

“These feet are made for walking”
5 March 2024
Jackson is feeling the full effect of the immunoglobin therapy that was done in PNorth. He now has 3 out of 5 reflexes in the right foot… the left foot is still trying to get there with 1 out of 5 reflexes.
Maintenance immunoglobin went up yesterday, so far so good. It was meant to be Saturday but Jackson had much more important plans… To go shopping! Being stuck in a hospital environment for over a month can take its toll, so off on the City bus they went and Jackson was able to get (trendy) shoes that will allow his ankle to be supported while he gains movement and reflexes. It was also the first time that Jackson had been out in public as the “guy in a wheelchair”. He took it in his stride and played staring games back at those that were looking for a little bit longer than what was needed.
Rob is home this Sunday to be with S & A for two weeks, I leave on Saturday.
A big thanks to all that have supported us and donated, cooked meals, done firewood, sausage sizzles, mufti days, looked after S & A… and just allowed us to take one day at a time. The support has been incredible.
The Give A Little will allow us to get S & A to ChCh to see their big brother, and also allow a little bit longer of bringing in only one wage. (Jackson, it is not there for a brand new PS5, but we will get one, one day)
THANKS ALL, we love ya!

A promotion at work, just purchased her first home, a bright future ahead of her. That all came crashing down in Jan-24 with the discovery of a lump in her breast, and an aggressive cancer diagnosis at age 33.
The diagnosis has set Avianca's world into a spin. Her career is on hold as she navigates her treatment plan. Her last few weeks have been a blur of appointments, needles and tests.
Alongside her chemo there is a drug called Pertuzumab which specifically targets the different proteins causing HER2-positive breast cancer. This drug will increase her chances of being cancer free after treatment. It costs $25k and unfortunately this is not funded for her.
The chemo she starts on March 1st will leave her infertile. Of all the things breast cancer will demand of her, this is the hardest and absolutely heartbreaking. To have the best chance possible of having a baby in the future Avianca needs to proceed with a non-funded egg retrieval at a cost of $13k.
Cancer is Avianca's reality now.
As friends & colleagues we wish to alleviate financial pressures and would be grateful for any gesture of support. Your generosity, love, kindness & prayers will make a meaningful difference in Avianca's future and the fight that is ahead.

Another round of thanks to you all!
The egg retrieval went well. It was an emotional roller coaster and I'm glad that part of the process is over.
I've started chemo and am having the private drug. The side effects are not nice but I'm trying my best to push through and stay positive. My hair is falling out :(
I don't have enough money to fund the final round of private treatment. Any donation no matter how small would be greatly appreciated.
My family and I thank you so much for making this possible.

Revised Goal Amount

We have decided to increase the goal amount to a more accurate figure now that Avianca has the final quote for Pertuzumab, and received the invoices for her fertility preservation.
We are hoping to raise as much as possible and appreciate all donations big and small.
Thank you :)

20 Days of Fundraising
11 March 2024
Posted by: Avianca Bohm
Thank you to everyone who has so generously donated, prayed, shared my story on social media and contacted my family directly.
As a family we are so appreciative and blown away by your kindness. It is amazing to know that we have so much support and that so many of you care about me and my future.
Unfortunately I had an unforeseen complication with my egg retrieval cycle. As such, the cost is $18k instead of the $13k quoted. I am still waiting for the final quote on the drug alongside my chemo to find out if it is still $25k.
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart 💜

My son Derek, who is 20 yrs old has been diagnosed with End-Stage Chronic Kidney Disease, and the situation is becoming increasingly critical as it has affected his heart. He is currently undergoing 3 times a week Hemodialysis in the Philippines.
In a beacon of hope, Derek's sister Ericka (19) has bravely decided to be his live kidney donor. This selfless act has given our family a chance at a brighter future, but the financial burden of medical expenses is overwhelming. This medical procedure is not publicly funded in my home country.
Due to this unforseen circumstances, his Visa to NZ cannot proceed because his condition made him medically inadmissible.
We are reaching out to our community, friends, and family for support during this challenging time. The funds raised will be used for Derek's kidney transplant, medical treatments, post-surgery care, and other associated costs. This will also help Ericka's recovery.
Your contribution, no matter how small, will make a significant difference in Derek and Ericka's journey toward recovery. We have set up a crowdfunding campaign where you can contribute and share our story with others who may be willing to help.
We understand that times are tough for everyone, and your thoughts, prayers, and shares are also immensely appreciated. Your kindness and generosity can truly change Derek's life.

For the past few days, i realized that in this cruel world that we are at, there are still countless people with good hearts. God Bless your Family. Here's a recent photo of Derek and Ericka.

A dreadful outcome after months of medical appointments trying to find the issue. Treatments have been tough, but so is Anna. Heading into Xmas 2023, it seemed to be under control.
But earlier this year, after suffering constant migraines, Anna received the devastating news that the cancer had spread to her brain. The prognosis is not good. Anna is desperate to spend as much quality time as possible with Tom and their daughters (7yrs & 10yrs) and to be with them for as long as possible.
Tom’s been off work, caring for Anna, taking her to appointments, being with her in the hospital when she’s in, keeping the kids routines going, & running their home. They are also researching unfunded treatment (Tucatinib) in the hope they can find something that will help extend Anna’s life.
At the moment, Anna is undergoing whole-brain radiotherapy which has been really hard on her. Up till a few months ago, Anna was a very active person. But now the treatments and the cancer are really affecting her energy levels and cognition. Simple tasks like getting dressed, or even walking, are proving challenging.
You couldn't find a nicer & more generous family. Any donations you can give to help will be deeply appreciated ❤️

Hi all. Just a quick update from us.
Firstly, we want to say thank you all for your generosity. It's been really heartwarming getting all your messages, and koha, be it on here, or offers to help with life admin, it's all been super helpful. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Last week we plucked up the courage to talk to our girls about what this years news meant for us. It was easily one of the hardest conversations Anna or I have ever had 💔. Our girls are just as gutted as we are, and we are grateful for the support they are getting from their friends families, and the wider Island Bay community ❤.
In that same week, due to the radiotherapy, Anna's hair started falling out, but Anna turned that into a positive, inclusive experience by letting our youngest, Gloria, shave what was left of it off. It was a fun afternoon 🙂.
Anna is doing a bit better now than she was a few weeks back, but a short walk up and down our street is about her physical limit at this stage. Short visits by well wishers are appreciated, but are also quite exhausting.
We are still unsure of what options we might have available going forward, but hope to have a conversation with Anna's oncologist Monday week to see what the best way forward is.
Thank you all.

Firstly, just want you say a massive thank you to everyone that has donated. We're extremely grateful to have so many people in our lives that love and care for us. Thank you all 🙏
Two weeks of daily radiotherapy finished for Anna on Friday. It was a bittersweet feeling. On one hand, radiotherapy is complete 🎉, on the other hand, that's as much radiotherapy as there's gonna be. Now we have to wait to meet Anna's oncologist, and see what the plan is. Really hoping there's a treatment available that'll help 🙏.
Cross your fingers for Anna🤞

Kylie asks
Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option and we don't have many houses in the lower North Island but we will try our best (note school holidays are very difficult to secure unfortunately). Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

15 June 2024
Hi all, a quick update - Poppy's blood levels got to an acceptable level so she can go back on chemo, which is great!! We are so encouraged at this good development, however it has been very scary for Chantel (Poppy's mum) as it is the very same medication that Poppy had such a dreadful reaction of paralysis last time. This time around the medical team are watching her vigilantly, and giving her another medicine to help her body quickly clear the chemo drug after each treatment, so that it doesn't build up to toxic levels again in Poppy's body. This seems to be working, but has created a new complication of messing with her potassium levels, which can have an affect on her heart and rhythms. Please pray the medical team finds the right balance of all these things and Poppy can continue to proceed through the treatment schedule, allowing no return of any cancerous growth. Thank you all for being such a supportive, committed team to these 2 wonderful people. God bless!

Poppy - update on chest infection and treatment
2 June 2024
Hi all, just a quick update as you remember, pray and think of Poppy and her Mum Chantel. They have been going to the hospital daily for the medicine needed to treat her chest infection. It is usually for 2-3 hours at a time but can be longer if a blood transfusion is needed. They have returned to Starship recently because her blood counts are not yet up to where they need to be. A bone marrow biopsy has showed initial results that look ok which we are very grateful for - ie, no return of cancer. But please let's be praying her bloods will recover quickly to get back on track with her chemo very soon, and with the goal of moving into the maintenance phase of her treatment. Also, we ask God to strengthen her little body that is very tired from all it has been through. Thanks for your aroha, prayers and giving!

Chest infection
1 May 2024
Thank you each deeply for your aroha, prayers and generosity. Chantel is so encouraged by this, especially for your prayers. A few days ago Poppy was transferred to Starship because of a diagnosed chest infection that has taken hold while her immunity is low. The medical team are working on identifying the bug through a scan and biopsy so that they can target it with the right medicine to treat effectively - please pray this can happen quickly and be eliminated. In that way she can get back on track with her chemo treatment which is currently on pause while this extra hurdle is dealt with. That's all - more update soon. Thank you all for being such a marvellous team around Poppy and Chantel. We are so thankful!

Poppy needs our prayers
28 April 2024
Thanks all for your thoughts, generous gifts and prayers for Poppy. Unfortunately, she had to spend her whole birthday in hospital due to an unusual bug that they were treating with 3 different antibiotics because her own immunity is so low from the chemo. Then yesterday we have heard from Chantel that Poppy is a lot sicker than they thought. This is a real blow for us to hear this, and we are together all standing with them as they have asked for prayer and are waiting to find out more. We ask you to pray with us, if you are believers in Jesus - for a marvellous miracle of healing. We wait and pray and look with expectation. We will keep you posted how she is going.

Poppy - Anzac Day!
23 April 2024
Hi all, Poppy's latest - while the chemo is rugged, they are needing to keep on schedule with it for it to continue doing its job. This unfortunately has been causing Poppy's blood count to plummet, leaving her vulnerable to infection and physically tired. There have been many bags of blood transfused - thank you to you blood donors out there! Poppy and her Mum are back in hospital for some time to stay clear of infection and to be closely monitored with the harsh impact of the treatment. While Poppy is showing such courage, she has been in isolation and rather bored! We are grateful for a therapist who comes daily with creative, inspired art and other activities that Poppy (and other kids) can do while in hospital. This is a lonely, tough journey for this special Mum and daughter unit, and they are so grateful for all of you cheering them on and supporting them how you can. Thank you! Please continue to pray for her blood levels to hold, and for the chemo to stay on schedule. And please give a little as you have ability to help with their ongoing costs while Mum is not working. Remember them esp on Anzac Day as Poppy has long been looking forward to this, her birthday - we hope and pray she can be out of hospital and in a nice setting for some of that day. We will keep you posted!

Another hurdle in the journey
11 April 2024
In March, as Poppy was telling her Mum a story, something was just not right - her words were coming out wrong. Chantel assumed tiredness but unfortunately, 1/2 hour later it happened again.
'Come straight up to the hospital!'
Another episode in the lifts-this time her arms had no movement & she couldn't speak at all. 5mins later back to normal! After several more episodes, she was admitted.
As we can imagine Chantel was getting super worried! CT scan showed nothing. It felt like a replay of the toxic reaction to chemo last year. An MRI soon confirmed that the changes present during the toxic reaction were back. After much discussion, it was decided that 1 of Poppy's meds was the culprit. Blood tests showed the levels of med were 2x the norm. Poppy had 8 more episodes over the next 2 days but wonderfully, they became less severe as the med levels dropped. Chantel was so thankful her daughter could speak properly again!
Having been discharged, both of them are very relieved & exhausted from the toll of this latest drama.
Poppy can no longer take this med at home & has swapped to one that can only be given in hospital. 4x week visits up there again. Poppy gets v tired of the hospital. It can be so hard for her to agree to go up there.
This latest setback is so hard on Poppy but we're deeply grateful her reaction was nowhere near as bad as last time.
Please keep them in prayer, continue your $ support to this wee family that is fighting so hard. We are grateful for you!

From Chantel (Poppy's Mum) - keep praying and supporting them please!
13 March 2024
Hi all thank you from my heart to each of you who has followed us on this extremely tough journey. I've been deeply touched, humbled & grateful for your prayers, msgs & support.
Sorry for this while to thank you. I've buried the trauma & grief down so far so I can function daily for Poppy. When I take a moment to think about what we've been through, I start to fall apart. I'm told I am a strong person & I'm doing well, but when I relive nearly losing Poppy twice & the hard journey, it makes me break down!
Reading your beautiful words & the love/support blows me away! The support from family & friends, from people we know & those we don't, brings tears to my eyes, restores my faith. I cannot express how much.
So thankful-Poppy is in remission! Yet we still have 2 yrs' treatment. We're now in an intense cycle. Poppy has chemo at Waikato 2x wk (up to 6 hrs/day!), many meds at home (up to 5/day) & 3 visits to Starship for Lumbar Punctures, & chemo.
Late April, enters 'Maintenance phase,' longest & final cycle. Supposed to be a bit easier & Poppy can finally start back at school (1-2 hrs as she is still so tired & regaining strength after awful chemo reaction), visiting friends & doing normal 13-year-old girl things.
Poppy’s 14th birthday is 25th April - focused on that! It makes Poppy smile to have this to plan toward after having her whole world turned upside down 6 mths ago.
Once again, thanks so very much. Knowing of so many special people in the world really brings joy to me!

Poppy at Christmas time!
29 December 2023
Meri Kirihimete one and all!
We are delighted to share an update on our loved friend Poppy on Christmas Day, feeling well for the whole day thankfully! - and able to really enjoy celebrations with her dear Mum Chantel, and wider family. Her bloods have come up enough so she can receive chemo again weekly for the next 6 weeks at Waikato, and a 3 weekly lumbar puncture up at Starship to monitor her health. She was very sick after the last chemo and so this has her feeling very worried how she will go this time - so please remember and pray for her. Please continue to give generously towards this little family, with Mum full-time caring for Poppy, and not able to work. They are so grateful for your care and love, as are we! Thank you for staying on this journey with them. We are believing for a wonderful outcome in time.

Poppy this week
10 December 2023
Kia ora, by way of update, Poppy has been transferred down to Hamilton where she will continue her chemo treatment down here due to lack of beds in Auckland. Her bloods are very low despite a couple of transfusions recently, and as you can imagine, her energy is greatly depleted with that - she needs to sit and lie down for most of the time, without energy to do much of anything else. This is hard on her emotionally, the boredom and isolation get to her naturally. Once her bloods come up to a healthy level, they are having to face the same chemo that she reacted to so badly, but this time it will be given in a different way and at a lower dose. She is still recovering from the toxic reaction effects and regaining her movement slowly, so we can all imagine how scary that must be to face this same medicine. It is needed so that they can hit the cancer effectively. Please pray with us that it will go ahead, and that her body will be protected and with no complications of any hint of toxic reaction this time. As you can imagine, this will be on her Mum's mind -ask for God's peace and hope over them both and for the cancer markers to continue to decline. Thank you each for your wonderful support and aroha and prayer.

Poppy's cancer is in remission!!!!!
10 November 2023
We are so thrilled to announce today's news that Poppy's cancer is in remission!! Wow, just fantastic! Thank you all - the doctor hurried straight to tell them this exciting outcome as soon as the results came in today from her recent bone marrow biopsy.
In regard to healing from the toxic reaction - she has progressed to sitting in a wheelchair, and she can stand for a short period. Movement in her hands and arms is coming along. She has bounced back from this bump in the road remarkably quickly. Thank you for your prayers, your gifts and your care.
It means so much to Poppy, Chantel and us!

Toxic reaction to medications
2 November 2023
Hi all, thanks again so much to each one of you for your generous gifts, and also to Poppy's schools that have rallied and donated through community fundraisers in support of her. We are so grateful for you all!
Poppy continues to have intensive chemo treatment as she battles the leukemia. Unfortunately last week she suffered a highly unusual toxic response to one of the chemo drugs and lost the use of all her limbs, one by one, and also her voice! As you can imagine, it was terrifying for Poppy and her Mum, who didn't know what was going on, and nor did the medical team for some time! After a transfer back to Auckland, eventually tests brought clarity for everyone what was happening.
We are so thankful that she has been recovering her voice (now fully) - phew, and it was the most beautiful sound for Chantel to hear her girl speak again. Her legs are gaining a little bit of movement. Her arms have yet to see recovery - and her sleep is very broken due to great discomfort for her.
Keep your prayers, aroha and support coming - thank you for standing with this sweet, beautiful little family.

Poppy this week
20 October 2023
Pic - one of Poppy's many blood transfusions.
Hi all, again a huge thank you to each and every one of you for so generously giving to Poppy and Chantel, as they continue to work through the daily challenges of this disease. Poppy has been spiking temperatures in recent days so has unfortunately had to be readmitted to emergency where she and her Mum will stay while she is on IV antibiotics to fight any infection going on. The cancer is not yet responding to the chemo - ie, it is not yet in remission. This is discouraging as many others on this treatment are in remission by this point. Those of you who pray to the Lord God, please persist in your prayers! The hospital is undergoing renovations, so Poppy and Chantel are in a room with no windows - a hard thing when they are spending all their time in 1 small hospital room, with no view to the outside world or to sunshine. Please remember them - we look forward to giving more and happier news soon. They are SOOOO heartened and touched at your care and aroha, to know there are so many in their corner with them. Thank you again to each one of you.

Poppy's treatment update
10 October 2023
Hi all, a truly heartfelt thank you to each one of you for your generous support of Poppy and Chantel, as they continue to journey through this marathon treatment, with all the ups and downs, and uncertainties. It has been intense. Poppy must have a lumbar puncture each week to check if leukaemia has entered her spinal fluid - we pray not! She also has had a recent blood transfusion due to severe tiredness, and low blood count. Poppy is having chemo given in various ways - targeted in 1 spot, IV, orally and also under her skin - many needles... She is being so very brave as is her Mum Chantel, as they go up to the hospital daily at the moment for hours and hours on end. Thank you for your support, prayers, thoughts and love - keep it coming please!! They are so grateful for you all, and are very humbled by your care and interest.

My sister is a 39 year old wāhine toa, she is Mum to three caring, talented, young men while also being an amazing Wife to her loving, supportive Husband of 18yrs. Nix has always been the first to offer help and the last to accept it (probably why I haven't told her I'm doing this 🫣). She is someone who leaves a lasting impression and she is one of the bravest wāhine I know.
3 years ago..while sacrificing her own whānau to serve alongside her husband as a soldier in the New Zealand Army, Nix was faced with her biggest battle yet - a sudden diagnoses of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL). This slow-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow threw our entire whānau for a loop.
After moving her and her whānau to Australia to support their talented sons, Nix has recently started an intense cancer treatment which means weekly tests, hospital stays and draining physical side effects. As you can imagine, this also means time away from work and their business.
I am hoping this page will reach enough kind-hearted people who may be able to donate anything big or small towards helping Nix and her whānau alleviate some stress. We will be forever grateful for any help that we receive, Nix deserves it 💜

What a Night it was
17 March 2024
Wednesday the 13th of March was a fantastic night at Mountainview High School Auditorium. The acts were tremendous, especially Mountainview's Josh Grobin (Cameron Hale), The Jazz Band, and of course the stunning voices of the Duncan sisters. To Brent and Catherine, thank you both very much for an hour and a half of lovely company and aroha. You should be proud of what your students have accomplished. To the audience, thank you for coming and supporting my drive to purchase the non-funded drugs I need.
Regardless of the amount of money raised, my family and I have never been offered such support and kindness. This is very humbling.

The next stage

Hi All, I have been well but after my 4th immunotherapy treatment, I feel quite tired at the end of each day. I am still working as a secondary teacher, as I can not sit around and do nothing. I have been busy getting in contact with the Minister of Health, Dr Steve Reti. to find out when the new funded drugs will be available. My case has been given to David Seymour. My latest email has been to the member of Rangitata, James Meager for his help with the new drugs. Once again than you to everyone who has supported my cause. Regards Eric Peters

Kia ora Eric, I’m glad to hear that your treatment is going well and the tiredness is inevitable. I had 2 blood transfusions already as my body is not bouncing back as fast as it could from one chemo session to the other.
Thank you so much for your personal fight and for representing every single cancer patient out here who could immensely benefit from additional funded drugs.
Stay strong and keep fighting. Lots of positive thoughts your way. Carla

So many thanks for all the support everyone has shown towards me and my whanau. On the 26th is my 4th immuno dose and hopefully that will go well. I have decided to fight for all cancer suffers, by sending an email outlining my story to Shane Reti, minister of health. My main question I ask is when are theses drugs going to be available to the public as I voted for National on that promise. I have received an email back saying they received it and will look into my issue. Watch. This space for their teply

We want to relieve the financial burden when the time comes for her beloved Husband and 3 Children that she will be leaving behind.
Sophia and Sam, the one who stole her heart, got married in March 2023, after being together for 8 years and welcoming Aengus in 2020 into their already blended family, Nushka (nearly 21) and Nieko (14).
On October the 9th Sophia went to ED with severe ongoing pain, they suspected appendicitis and she went in for surgery immediately, during the surgery they found a small tumour which turned out to be stage 3 bowel cancer, they thought they had removed it all and she was cancer free, she proceeded with chemotherapy to ""clean up the dust"" however as time went on pain continued and worsened and with further investigation it became apparent that the cancer had been spreading and it was aggressive and incurable.
Any funds received will be used for her funeral and any costs that may arise during this time. We want them to focus on supporting each other, and spending quality time together rather than stressing about finances.

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

A couple of weeks ago I ran in the Old Ghost Ultra, a out and back rather than the usual point to point due to a predicted electrical storm. The event showcased all the beauty the west coast has to offer, with raging rivers, swing bridges, wild life and lush green native bush. My day was surrounded with kind people who enjoyed my consistant, easy pace, following behind, dropping off, speeding ahead and rejoining, cheered by the volunteers, having the opportunity to promote fuelinghope to captive audience on the FB life stream from Specimen Point. As the heavens opened and the trail became boggy, with a little tumble, I picked myself up returning to my familiar easy pace, with a burst of energy as I neared the finishing line where I was welcomed by 2 good friends, drenched to the skin, looking like a sogging rag doll but so appreciative of the privilege of being able to run the 85kms with beautiful people who too want to preserve and protect our trails for future generations to enjoy.

would love to share a snippet of my 3 week experience at the FCC & clinic.Vanuatu is a nation of approx 80 islands, 6 regional health centres,1 hospital & the FCC.Just to get some idea of the health provision in Vanuatu, their hospital has 1 ventilator, 2 ICU beds, 1 steriliser, 2 theatres and a A&E opened in 2014Every health service costs in Vanuatu, 6,000vt ($60) for maternity, 7500vt ($7.50)per night including emergency, medical or surgical, huge outlays for the average Nivan.The clinic at FCC, founded in 2015, has expanded with a second dental clinic in progress, a pharmacy, a room available for a laboratory.When patients present to the FCC they are triaged in & charged accordingly,1500 VT or about $1.25 NZ the same price as a bus ticket-giving all Ni-Van's exceptionally affordable health care(medical outreaches inland continue to be free)As a nonprofit organisation, the clinic depends upon outside support with utility bills like power, simular in what you would expect to pay in NZ! Some presenting complaints we see at the clinic is Yaws-painless bacterial ulcers belonging to the same family as syphilis, skin wounds(bleach baths are generally recommend to prevent wounds becoming infected)muscular ailments etc Skin diseases and presentations of leprosy are also treated at the clinic.The clinic may see any number of patients each day, but just as the physical is treated, Nivan culture valves the holistic aspect of their well being therefore appointments are never rushed

28 March 2023
Its been five weeks since my Tarawera miler (160km), and so, with a little down time on the eve of the Northburn 100, I have a challenge of a different sort.
Where Tarawera had the distance, the Northburn has the elevation, proudly boasting 4,000 metres over 60km, that's mt cook and some.
I'm so grateful for the generous donations made over the past year with over $1000 gifted for my Tarawera event.
All at the Family Care Centre greatly appreciate your donations, with funds used for medical supplies and resources. With the recent cyclones to collide with Vanuatu causing superficial damage to the centre, donations received will also greatly assist in the centres repairs.
At the time when Cyclone Judy and Kevin impacted the Teouma Valley, 120 locals from the Nivan community sort refuge at the centre. There, they were provided with food and shelter.
This June I am super excited to be utilising my nursing skills, supporting the staff at the FCC and serving the Nivan community for 3 weeks.
This will be my first opportunity to volunteer at the centre unlike previous years where I have volunteered on the YWAM medical ships.
Volunteering at the centre will bless me with a wonderful opportunity to see first hand the dental clinic, steriliser and other supply's and resources your donations have contributed towards .
While in Vanuatu, I will ensure that I make regular updates on my Fuelling Hope FB pg for you all to see.
My time at the FCC wouldn't be possible without the generous support from the College of Emergency Nurses (CENNZ), who graciously awarded me a South Pacific Nurses grant of $1,000. This has greatly assisted me with my accommodation and travel costs.
As for the rest of the year and where my running journey may take me - maybe partaking in a nation wide elevation challenge and a some adventure training that incudes utilising my navigation skills.

Fuelling Hope 2022
12 July 2022
Running, training and races have taken a new direction with many events cancelled due to Covid restrictions. However, where some doors have temporary closed, new opportunities have presented themselves, sharing in some running and fast packing adventures with friends and family - staying overnight in huts, bivys and even a night out under the stars.
Not one to have training put to waste (with the cancellation of the Tarawera 160km and Northburn 100km until 2023), I took the time available to complete a loop of the Queen Charlotte Sounds, running from my unit to Picton, then from Cooks landing back through Anakiwa, to return to my unit.
Considering a difficult year all round, everyone has continued to be super generous answering the call for much needed equipment including the purchase of a dental and medical sterilizer (to replace the electric frying pan), hydrolic repairs for the center's dental chair and recent the purchases of Blood Pressure cuffs and wound care supplies - none of this would be possible without the display of kindness shown by you to the people of Vanuatu where lives have been positively impacted.
On a side note Mel (Mel is the primary nurse at the Family Care Centre), and the Ni-Van community have gifted me a new dress to run in, made to size, to alternate with my original dress.

Fueling hope 2021
30 July 2021
2020-2021 has been a particularly eventful year, feeling particularly blessed for the opportunity to compete in events that wouldn't be possible else where in the world. Unfortunately with the boarders closed, overseas medical outreaches have been placed on hold, however my hope is the boarder to Vanuatu will be open soon that I maybe able to volunteer as a nurse at the Family Care Center. My primary focus for my fund raising effects has been set on a sterilizing system for the Family Care Center where currently a electric frying pan is used to sterilize dental and medical equipment. Generally a new sterilizer costs $12,000 or second hand $6,000 to $8,000. This past year approx.$4,500 has been generously donated to Fueling Hope including regular donors. I have had plenty of adventures and new experiences including cross country, fast packing the Old Ghost and Heaphy (next month), running some stunning NZ trails including the Routeburn, Northburn station and in October Taupo Ultra gearing up in preparation for my first miler in February. Thank you so much for your continual support which is always so appreciated.

Fuelling Hope 2021
15 February 2021
2020-2021 has been a particularly eventful year, feeling especially blessed for the opportunity to continue running in events. While sporting events throughout the world have been cancelled, the medical outreaches within the South Pacific have been affected also. However this has not hampered my fund raising effects with my primary focus set upon a sterilizer for the Vanuatu Family Care Center - currently an electric frying pan is being used to sterilize their dental and medical equipment.
I'm writing this Fuelling Hope update while flying home on the back of competing in the Tarawera Ultra Marathon, 102km event, while taking me just over 16 and a half hours, it gave me plenty of opportunities to think about my ""why"" to my running adventures and those my running effects benefit, motivating me to do my best for my South Pacific neighbors.
Building up to up the Tarawera I competed in the 33km Able Tasman Classic, a piece of stunning New Zealand coastal trail and the 53km Crater Rim, uniquely beautiful but challenging with its steep and technical terrain. This April I plan to run the 85km Old Ghost trail on the west coast with friends and the Routeburn in the beautiful Fiordland along with a 50km Taupo Ultra in October.
My sincere gratitude and appreciation for your continual support. You can also follow me on my Fueling Hope FB page for further updates.

2019 ended with a hiss and a roar, returning from a three week medical outreach in the providence of Oro, PNG, then entering and competing in some stunning back yard events including the Crater Rim 30km and The Blue Lake 24hr Challenge. To say the 24hr Blue Lake Challenge was a stretched would be an understatement, experiencing the highs and lows of running throughout the night, managing the waves of nausea that accompanied me and the discomfort of calf cramps. However I hobbled my way over the line completing over a 120km, the furthest thus far in a single event. With The Blue Lake Challenge under my belt, I thought it would lead me in good standing for the Tarawera 102km in February 2020 but unfortunately it wasn’t to be with a back injury 5 days before the event. Further cancellations of the Route burn for the second year in a row and other organised events due to the covid-19 have not put a damper to my fund raising effects for Vanuatu’s Family Care Centre where people have continued to give generously donating over $4,000 in the last six months alone. Therefore, this has enabled the Care Center to build a new dental suite providing affordable dental care to all Ni-Vans. In the coming months I plan to run the Able Tasman, a 33km run in October and Bolder Bay classic in the lead up to the 102km Tarawera Ultra Marathon in Febrary 2021. Thank you again for your ongoing and generous support.

Thank you so much for your ongoing support over the last 3 years while I continue to fund raise for Marine Reach and the Family Care Centre in Port Villa - A inexpensive medical, dental, midwifery clinic and training centre. From running my first race, the Tarawera 50km in 2017, continuing throughout 2019 with my fund raising entering and racing events including the 20km Oparara Wildness Trail Race in the beautiful Kahurangi National park, Blue Lakes 24hr Challenge, 30km Crater Rim Challenge and the 60km Kepler - all while wearing a traditional island (Aelan) dress. For 2020 I hope to challenge myself a tad more by running the Tarawera's 102km trail race in Febuary and the Routeburn in the beautiful Fiordland. Recently I have returned from Papua New Guinea, volunteering with the Primary Health Team with YWAM/Marine Reach, organizations whose ships offer free medical /dentistry /ophthalmology services to the isolated communities of the South Pacific - where dentists, doctors, nurses, OTs and physios and ophthalmologists, volunteer their time,providing care and medical assistance.

Thank you so much for supporting me throughout my training leading up to, and the day of, Tarawera's, 50km ultra-marathon November 2017 and the 12 days of Christmas virtual charity run - running 200km over 12 days. My fund raising effects for 2018 has had some fantastic support with over $4000 in donations including those from my give-a-little page - $1000 of which I was able to donate to the Family Care Center in Port Vila, Vanuatu, where local Ni-Vans have the opportunity to free medical care as well as a safe house for women and children who are exposed to violence. This years funding raising effects started with entering some awesome local races including the 17km Arrowsmith mountain race with 1182 total elevation and the 20km Oparara Wildness Trail Race in the beautiful Kahurangi National park. Shortly after competing in my next race, the 26km Captain Cooks Landing in the Queen Charlotte Sounds, I will be setting out on my next medical outreach to Lae, PNG, returning later in the year to compete in the 60km Kepler as my main fund raiser for 2018 - all while wearing a traditional island (Aelan) dress. Marine Reach are a organization whose ships serve the isolated and coastle communities of the South Pacific as well as those in PNG and Panama - where volunteer dentists, doctors, nurses, OTs and physios and ophthalmologists, provide free medical care and assistance.
""Pacific Hope"" is one of Marine Reaches medical ships that transports crew and medical staff to the isolated communities of the South Pacific and now is supporting the communities of Panama after the latest devastating cyclone. Fuel is the greatest expense and with funds I hope to raise will enable Marine Reach the opportunity to help communities in the South Pacific and further afield.

A fun-loving, happy, bubbly gal, who has been so excited to become a new mum to her first child with partner Shayne. On the 7th June 2024 at Blenheim hospital Baby Bronty arrived healthy and strong. Sadly, Courtney has fallen critically ill post-labour.
After battling influenza A and a 3-day labour, resulting in an emergency C-section, complications arose as Courtney developed pneumonia post-labour. Not long after welcoming baby Bronty into the world, Courtney’s health declined further as her vital organs could no longer cope. A medical team flew down from Auckland, connected Courtney to an external lung machine, and flew her from Blenheim to Auckland hospital where she currently lies in a stable, but critical condition.
Connected to a life support machine and kidney dialysis, Courtney is currently in an induced coma to help monitor her condition and give her struggling organs a chance to get back on track. Though she is far from her home in Blenheim, she is in the best place with specialist care, and Baby Bronty and partner Shayne are at her side. Their family from the North Island have also rallied around them, providing emotional support during this challenging time.
However, the financial strain of the unknown is a stress lingering for her family, as they wait for an update on her condition.
Please donate to remove this pressure on Courtney and her family so they can focus on her recovery. Your donation will be undeniably appreciated.

23rd Dec '22 Marama went into a 9 hour surgery where Drs removed over half her tongue, cut down her lip, chin & right side of her neck to remove 50 Lymph nodes to get ahead of this cancer & remove as much as they could to give her the best chance of a future in life. She had to learn to speak, eat & drink again.
Starting the new year '23 once Marama's body was recovered enough she needed to get straight into Radiation & Chemo. Before starting treatment we found out 1/50 Lymph nodes had cancer cells in it. For 6 weeks she travelled daily for treatment.
Finishing in April, 1 month later in May she noticed a lump on the left side of her neck. Struggling with Lymphedema specialists assured us for 5 months that the lump was just her lymph nodes struggling to drain - regardless of it growing. Come October, scans & a Biopsy were done. The cancer is now Stage 4C where there are now spots on her lungs.
After 4 treatments of Pembrolizumab, results showed no luck in reversing or stopping the spread. Our specialist is trying Carboplatin IV every 3-4 weeks. With 14 days of Capecitabine tablets. Both are types of Chemo.

9 May 2024
Kia ora everyone,
We received amazing results from the first 3 rounds of Chemotherapy. Every single cancer growth has reduced in size, more than half in size for every growth. Including where the largest spot has almost completely diminished. Although we have been made aware of a growth in Maramas' bone on her spine - even so, it showed that the bone is healing (Chemo also targeted this). What this means is that the Cancer is currently being MANAGED, it is currently UNDER CONTROL.
Treatment, although it has so far given us the best results we could ask for (happy tears) - woefully, it cannot cure Marama. All we can do is keep this under control and managed.
Our next step is we will be doing another 3 rounds of the same treatment. Which does take the absolute life out of Marama. It takes a massive toll on her body - after her third round she became hospitalised. To try manage this better this next time round, she will be taking blood tests weekly to have a close eye kept on her. As well as a 30-40% decrease of the medicine in her infusions. She should still have great results regardless of the decade, as the cells are super sensitive to this treatment as seen in the results. This way, it just means Marama will hopefully be able to cope with the side effects better.
Financially, it is difficult. We need your continued support to help fund Maramas' care and treatment. Without it, we wouldn't be able to control the cancer.
Let's keep on fighting the fight, together.

Change in treatment
20 March 2024
Whanau, friends, associates.
We really need your help to continue funding Marama's care and treatment.
The 4 treatments for Pembrolizumab rounded to costing $36,000. That doesn't include fuel or Maramas' Lymphedema treatment. Our specialist costs $350 every time we see him. Our new treatment (Carboplatin IV every 3-4 weeks with 14 days of Capecitabine tablets) costs $600 every time, which is a lot cheaper but still takes a toll on our family. Please continue to help our Whanau, Marama, Xavier & Amiri to feel loved and supported at this extremely difficult time.

The hope beyond Immunotherapy for our trio <3
6 February 2024
To our family, friends and supporters. After 4 courses of Pembrolizumab and more Radiation we didn't get the news we all yearned for. Our scan has showed us progression for Maramas type of cancer. Progression in her lungs and neck. Thats not going to stop us though, our specialist is fighting for Maramas length of time & life just as much as we are. Without going into too much detail, our next course of action is a type of Chemotherapy where every 3 weeks Marama with have an infusion as well as pill form Chemo. Today Tuesday 6th of February Marama had her first infusion. Depending on how Maramas body responds will determine our next step over the next 6 weeks. Our course of medical support continues to be private as this is much better care for our Marama, this also means continued self funding. Between funding our care and treatment we are also taking into account the quality time our trio spend together. We are aiming to send our trio on a holiday of some sorts soon. Please continue to tautoko in any way you can.. share, love, spread, donate, fundraise. We will continue to keep you updated as much as possible. Nga mihi <3 xo

3rd Pembrolizumab (Immunotherapy) & Radiation done and dusted!
3 January 2024
Kia Ora everyone,
We hope you all had a lovely, relaxing Christmas & New Years. This time of the year is a great reminder & time to cherish loved ones.
Over this period Marama received Radiation treatment to the lump on her neck. It was hard for her & us to watch her go through this - the neck isn't a comfortable place to Radiate. She's reached a week post radiation which is where it's at its most uncomfortable time. And can I just say - she's done AMAZING! She had her moments but we wouldn't be human if we didn't. She is always rising above the circumstances which is so powerful. This is the most rawest, tough time but she does not let it define who she is.
Yesterday (Tues 2nd January '24) we travelled to Palmerston North for the 3rd time to receive our medicine 'Pembrolizumab'. Each time this costs $8,716.
One of the hardest aspects for Marama, is sharing her current circumstances on social media for the public to see/know about & to ask for help. But we do need your support not only for Marama but for Xavier & Amiri, so they can have their māmā continue raising them through their childhood.
To support in other ways, we also run fundraisers which are through our Facebook page ""Hope for Marama"". Feel free to join our page to tautoko. Link - https://www.facebook.com/groups/702788481952660
In 3 weeks we will be receiving our 4th treatment followed by a scan which then give us results as to whether the treatment is giving us that hope we need.
Ngā mihi nui

Approaching 2nd treatment with positive energy <3
5 December 2023
Kia Ora family, friends, associates and the wider New Zealand community,
Thank you all so far for who have supported us all at this time. Whether that's by sharing, donating, fundraising, spreading the word or in any other way of love and kindness.
Marama will receive her 2nd treatment next Tuesday 12th December. Due to Marama's strength & the AMAZING private Oncologist we have on board for our journey - Marama has been feeling more comfortable than she was prior to treatment starting.
This will be due to multiple contributing factors. Ie; daily medications, lifestyle changes (eg: no smoking, exercise, nutrition), the natural strength her children Xavier & Amiri give her) AND fingers crossed the Immunotherapy itself.
I will continue to keep you all updated as it is a trying time of the year with Christmas & the new year approaching but even so please keep Marama, Xavier & Amiri in your thoughts and prayers.
Please continue to tautoko in every way possible that you personally can. You have all been amazing, the support we feel is so strong and we as a whanau feel it. The financial stress of this journey has been alleviated because of you all. We couldn't appreciate or thank you all enough, there are no words that could amount to the gratitude we feel.
Again, thank you & keep the supportive energy strong flowing.

Marama's journey for HOPE <3
24 November 2023
Thank you so much to all who have donated, fundraised, and are supporting us through our journey of hope. Marama had her first treatment on Tuesday of Immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab). Not only that but we met our new private Oncologist in Palmerston North who is absolutely nothing less than amazing. TODAY (Friday 24th Nov) Marama has spoken about her new daily pain management medication and for the first time ever she feels no pain from the lump in her neck. Hopefully she continues to feel more comfortable, and if not our Oncologists says HE WILL HELP with reducing/TAKING AWAY our girls pain! He has kicked the Wellington Radiology Department up their backsides to see Marama again to possibly give her radiation to this nasty lump. We would not have been able to get Marama into this position without the help of us all.
Unfortunately we are not done yet though, please continue to keep Marama in your thoughts, spread the word, and engage where you can in our fundraising for Hope. We do have a goal now on our page, and that is 93 thousand dollars. This would give us our 10 treatments of immunotherapy + the continuous assistance from this AMAZING Oncologist.
This is our BEST chance to lengthen the lifespan of our girl, not only that but improve the quality of time our boys Xavier & Amiri will have with their Mother Marama.
Really take the time to look at this picture of Marama, despite her circumstances she is spreading the most gorgeous positive smile <3
TAUTOKO!!

Marama and her 1st treatment
21 November 2023
Kia Ora everyone,
Thank you so much to who have donated so far, you are all so appreciated so far. This is a little update on Marama’s journey. Today (21st November 2023) because of all of your help we are able to have Marama start her FIRST treatment today in Palmerston North. This is an amazing start. She has to have a treatment every 3 weeks. We start with 3-4 to see if it is going to help at all. We pay ONE treatment at a time which is just short of $9500. We will keep you all updated on how we go but for the meantime keep Marama, Xavier and Amiri in your thoughts as we support and love them along the way. Please keep sharing and/or donating if you’re in a position to. Our boys need their māmā earth side. Nga Mihi, Olivia

I reach out with a plea for Paulo, a young Brazilian facing brain cancer.
His journey began unexpectedly, experiencing a seizure while driving. Miraculously, his friend safely pulled over.In the hospital, Paulo learned of a Grade 3 to 4 brain tumor, prompting a swift biopsy. With no local support in Auckland, he relocated to Christchurch for better care.
A month later, Paulo began treatment. The tumor proved too extensive for immediate surgery, so he embarked on a plan to shrink it, demanding resilience.
Now, Paulo needs our strength. Medical costs weigh heavily, and he won't work for a year.
He also supports his 74-year-old mother, caring for him in New Zealand.
Support Paulo's journey by contributing to this fundraiser. Your generosity, big or small, provides relief for Paulo's health and well-being. Show him he's not alone
Stand with him in solidarity, love, and hope.
Thank you for supporting Paulo's fight against brain cancer.

Sadly, the reality is deeply sobering for Debbie, Ange, Petra and Drew, as the long-term prognosis is not encouraging. The treatment will be difficult and given the unpredictable nature of her condition, this casts a dark shadow of worry over her future.
Yet, in the face of this daunting battle Debbie remains a beacon of strength, her spirit unwavering despite the significant challenges lying ahead. Yet she does not need to walk this path alone. Together, we can wrap her in a blanket of support and help Deb, Ange and the kids in any way we can.
Your contribution, no matter how big or small, can provide much needed relief during this terribly challenging time. Please, any donation is a gesture of love, solidarity and a visceral reminder that she’s surrounded by family, friends and a community who care deeply for her so they can focus on what truly matters – her health, and cherishing every moment together as a united team of 4!
As we all know, Deb and Ange are the first to roll up their sleeves and help others in challenging times, now it’s our turn to help her when she needs us most.

24 April 2024
I just wanted to give you a quick update. First thanks so very much for your generosity and love - words aren't enough!
By way of update, Mum has now completed 3 rounds of Chemotherapy. She is as positive as ever and finds happiness in everything she does. She loves spending her down time with friends and family who pop around. She says the people and company help her so much.
Her second round of chemotherapy wasn’t the smoothest of sailing, but we take each day as it comes.
When mum is feeling up to it, we spend a lot of family time together doing bucket list things. We recently had an awesome Helicopter trip to Waiheke, and set off to Fiji for a family holiday reminiscing our family holidays as young kids. Sitting around talking each others ears off, lots and lots of cuddles and snuggles. Mum is now having a week break between her treatment as she is half way through. Dad and her are going to send some well deserved time together in beautiful Queenstown.
Mum and Dad made their first trip back home to Whangamatā last week and hope to make it a more regular thing. So fingers crossed this can happen.
Grateful for all of the love and support we have all been shown. Although times are testing, and each day brings a new challenge your messages, notes, food deliveries and everything in between mean the absolute world to us and helps brighten our days.
Thank you all so very very much we appreciate everything you have done for us!

Janet has recently (in March) sought private cancer assistance where we are hoping they have found a drug that, if successful, may give Janet that very precious extra time.
Janet is a giver in life and never asks for help or expects help. We have (over time) been able to convince her to accept help from the kindness of others.

Janet has been doing really well on the unfunded drug Cetuximab.
She has had more energy and been working full time and has been better than she has been since last year.
Janet caught Covid which meant she had one of her treatments cancelled. She has then been in hospital with a blood infection. So a second treatment was cancelled, which has been disheartening.
Janet got onto this infection quickly and is doing well. She is hoping to be released from hospital soon and to restart her treatment again on Wednesday 3rd July.
Thank you all for the ongoing support.
If you are able to share this page again, it would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.

A message from Janet...
28 April 2024
""I am extremely grateful and humbled by the support I have received and the beautiful comments and words of encouragement. The analysis that came back from the US has been very helpful to the oncology team. It has identified the unfunded drug Cetuximab as the best fit for me as it is not processed in the liver. I start treatment on Wednesday and am very hopeful for extra time. Thank you all again for your generosity.""
Funds raised on Givealittle will also be used to cover the costs of Cetuximab.

We are creeping closer to the halfway mark of the quarantine period for our embryos. It has been a long 6 weeks with lots of waiting and time filling to pass the time a little faster. Once the embryos come out of quarantine they will stay frozen until we have worked out a date that best suits Dani and James and us to try for our first transfer.

Exciting Update!
16 March 2024
Thanks so much to you all for your patience waiting for an update on where we are at with our surrogacy journey.
Although it’s been a lengthy process so far, Candice, Andy, James and I are so excited to share that this week we received the confirmation that our application to the Ethics committee was accepted and Candice and Andy can now start preparing for their round of IVF which will be able to be completed in the coming months! So exciting!
From here, once the embryo is created, there will be a 3 month quarantine period before we can attempt to implant and hope for a positive pregnancy test. Super exciting news and we are so happy to be one big step closer to our end goal!
Once again a huge thank you all for your love, support, donations and kind words. Every one of them has mean a lot to us!

Hi everyone,
Just wanted to quickly check in and let you know that although this process takes much longer than we anticipated, with sometimes longs wait times for appointments, we are making great progress. Counselling, medical tests, lawyers meeting etc have all been underway and we are really happy with how we are progressing, just taking it all as it comes.
Your donations, kind words and checking in have all been so appreciated! Thanks heaps for being here for the journey 🥰
We look forward to sharing more about this in the new year 😍

We are making progress!
25 September 2023
Just wanted to share some exciting news that James and I had our first counselling session today (with FA’s Dunedin Counsellor) and have our next one booked in for next month.
I’ve also done my bloods and a few other tests to ensure that all is well to proceed.
Fertility Associates in chch is very busy and booked up but Candice and Andy have both of their counselling sessions booked and we will have one all together sometime after that.
The journey to surrogacy is lengthly and requires us to submit an application to ECART (Ethics Committee on Assisted Reproductive Technology) for approval before we can start. completing all the required things alone takes a minimum of 3-4 months to complete. We are smashing through that list!
Thanks so much once again for sharing this space with us and supporting Candice, Andy and I through this journey.
There is so many crazy and out dated things with our surrogacy laws but I’ll leave you with this part that just blows my mind…
Candice and Andy form an Embryo (100% their biological baby) and as the surrogate I have full legal rights to the baby if I was to change my mind (don’t worry, I won’t) but what’s just as crazy…on babies 1st birth certificate I will be their birth mother and James (or the surrogates partner) will be listed as the birth father! Isn’t that just mad.
Candice and Andy then go through the processes to adopt THEIR baby and will get a new birth certificate although this takes 4-6 months. Such a crazy journey! ❤️

Their story in my words Part 3
2 September 2023
After some time Candice and Andy were told the sad news that the safest option for Candices health and the best chance for a baby would be to find a surrogate to carry their baby and to do a round of IVF to create an embryo. While this is a difficult journey emotionally, it is the best and safest option.
One huge challenge to this, is the financial toll it will take. From the advice they have received, they will need approximately $30,000 to cover a round of IVF, the cost of lawyers, counselling sessions and all the medial testes needed. This will be a long and lengthy journey which I can excitedly share has already started! Candice and Andy have met with Fertility Associates and have more appointments in the coming months.
You maybe wondering how I fit in? Well I am going to be their surrogate and have fully committed to be on their journey with them. Right now I want nothing more than to see their family grow and for them to have a healthy, happy baby in their home.
I know with or without your support Candice and Andy will make this happen with talks of re mortgaging their home and Candice using her talent to paint artwork and sell on her instagram page @candicreativenz However, I ask if you have anything to spare whether it’s small or big, it would go a long way to supporting them and their dream. I know I have been so lucky not to have faced the challenges that they have and I’m forever grateful for the blessing of 2 healthy girls. It’s now their turn.

Their story in my words part 2
2 September 2023
Thorough testing offered once Hudson had passed they discovered Candice has a medical condition called Antiphospholipid Syndrome which adds complications to her ability to grow her babies to full term. With this in mind the medical professionals helped to plan a pregnancy for Candice and Andy that would include daily injections and careful monitoring to give baby the best chance of making it to at least 30 weeks. The careful monitoring and medication were going well until at 25 weeks it became safer for Angus to be born, than to stay inside his comfy home.
Candice and Andy were brave, resilient and incredibly courageous as they stayed by Angus bedside as he spent 104 days in the Christchurch Hospital NICU unit. He knew when his parents were there, holding him and giving skin to skin as his stats instantly improved. They put everything on hold to give everything to Angus and his chance at survival. He accomplished many feats and gave hope to his parents although this journey was always going to be long and tough.
All of a sudden Angus’ health declined and after a long battle his parents held him for the last time and said goodbye as he passed away after 104 days giving it everything he had.Angus not only broke their hearts, but also those of us who know Candice, Andy and how incredible they are as parents. Attending Angus’ memorial service was one of the hardest things I have ever done.

Their story in my words part 1
2 September 2023
Sadly my beautiful friends haven’t had the easiest journey after making the decision to start trying for a family back in September 2020. While the last three years have brought excitement, hope and joy, it has been quickly followed up by immense heart break and pain no parent should have to go through.
Candice and Andy began trying for a family over three years ago and discovered that their journey wasn’t going to be ‘textbook’…month after month, the negative tests started to take a toll when they finally fell pregnant. Thinking this was their chance, they were excited to share the news with their close family and friends before they sadly suffered a miscarriage and then another. Desperate for solutions to why this was so difficult they were referred to experts for tests to help. Although they deep down knew something wasn’t right, the experts couldn’t find anything wrong and suggested they keep trying.
They were ecstatic when they fell pregnant with Hudson and he brought them so much hope as they ticked off the first 12, then 20 week milestones. They had shared the news with all of their family and friends and Candices growing bump was a reminder that having a baby was finally their reality. Unfortunately, Candice and Andy were hit with a devastating blow when Hudson passed away in utero at 24 weeks. Their whole world was tipped upside down and they grieved the loss of Hudson, their first born son.

Sorry if this may be too personal. I have been done the IVF journey myself.
Is your friend looking for embroyos thru IVF or just surrogate and cost of IVF?
I am asking as i have a frozen embryo we are planning on donating to the clinic
Danielle
Hi, thanks for your question. At this stage from the medical advice they have been given, it’s very likely that Candice and Andy will be successful through a round of IVF to create their own embryos, therefore this would allow them to have their own biological baby through surrogacy. So at this stage our plan is for them to complete a round of IVF and me to carry their embryo as their surrogate. Thanks for your message though. What an incredible thing to do to consider donating your embryos, just amazing! ❤️"

I love life, my family, my friends, music, gardening & people. Late last year I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Breast Cancer.
I discovered a large lump in my left breast that wasn't there earlier in the day. A little surprised & concerned I headed to the doctor to get it checked out. A mammogram & ultrasound didn't show much so a biopsy was done.
As I watched the bus leave with my daughter & husband for a school camp one morning, my phone rang. It was a request to meet with the doctor that afternoon. My heart immediately sank, I knew it was bad. At the appointment I was told I had breast cancer, Grade 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Estrogen.
I was immediately referred to the surgical team, with the MRI & CT scan showing chemo was unlikely to shrink it. A mastectomy was needed due to the tumour's size, along with removing lymph nodes in my armpit.
On 20th Dec, my breast was removed via mastectomy. The tumour was 10.5cm wide & 6 of the 18 lymph nodes removed were cancerous (meaning high potential for spreading).
This journey is an emotional roller-coaster for everyone & is still unfolding. Telling my girls & Andrew that I have cancer was the hardest day of my life. Every day brings new emotions to process. My babies were aware something was happening from the first day the lump appeared & their cuddles mean everything. I planned to be here for their lives & now we're doing everything we can to make sure I am.

17 June 2024
Posted by: Teresa Watson
Last week was a big milestone, I had my last chemo infusion signaling the end of my chemo journey :)
Quite unexpectedly, I hadmixed emotions about this - On one hand I was really pleased to be finishing chemo, it has not been an easy journey with the various side effects and impact on daily life. One the other hand this signaled a move away from what had become consistent, the 3 weekly schedule, the familiar faces and a new step into the unknown. These contrasts were challenging to feel content with - so much so I was unsure how I would feel at the end of the infusion and would I feel comfortable to ring the bell?
As I sat there in the oncology day ward for the last time I reflected on my journey, the kind faces of the nurses, their unwavering positivity and helpful kind demeanor. I now knew many of them over this journey and appreciated their efforts so much. The infusion itself went well this time, no reaction, only two attempts to get the line in this time which was great news. I have scar tissue in my left arm from the many needle insertions and blood tests so it is definitely getting trickier to find a vein these days.
By the end of my infusion and at the encouragement of tall there, I did choose to ring the bell. All the nurses stood with me as I rang it, supporting me, happy to see me finished with this leg of the journey with hugs all round afterwards.
I am happy I rang the bell, I didn't realise how much I needed to.
Now the next step begins: Radiotherapy...

5th Chemo Done
29 May 2024
Posted by: Teresa Watson
It's been a busy wee while between updates!
Chemo was last Tuesday; I was a bit apprehensive as I wasn't sure what would happen 😅 Having had a number of Chemo infusions already on this journey, some of the veins in my right arm have areas where they have thickened, meaning I have bump patches that can be felt by hand and also interfere with the nurses getting a good line in for the next infusion. Because of this, it took 4 attempts to get my infusion line in on Tuesday. I looked a bit like a pin cushion afterwards, but lucky number four was a good one and I had no issues with that. As suspected though I did experience a hypersensitivity reaction, after a few minutes of chemo starting my chest got really tight and it was tricky to get a good breath. The nurse stopped the infusion quickly and we waited a good 15mins to see if things settled, which they did. Because of this they slowed my infusion down, to 25% of normal speed, then as time went on and things continued to go well, they bumped up the inusion rate so eventually I was back up to 100% speed.
Like last time, the white blood cell injection and the body aches hit me hard, definitely more fatigue this time too and it is taking me longer to get back to normal me. Naps are a necessity these days and the couch is a common place I drift off in the middle of the day.
Here's a pic of me and my girls at the Ashhurst Pink Ribbon Long Morning Tea - I upped my brave and shared my journey so far with a lovely group of people 🥰

4th Chemo completed
5 May 2024
Posted by: Teresa Watson
This week's treatment has definitely been a bit of a learning curve. I had been quite apprehensive about the next type of chemo - I already knew through discussion with my oncologist the next three treatments would be rougher, have a higher chance of a hypersensitivity reaction during infusion, wider range of side effects, potential health disbenefits and increased body aches. Apparently this next type is always done second in a full series of chemo as people are less likely to complete the full series. I wanted to make an informed choice about this next part of my chemo journey: what is the perceived benefit from continuing with the planned series, what about doing a different type of chemo instead, what if we ended the chemo journey now what would my risk profile look like? Following this discussion and gaining more understanding I chose to continue. This particular chemo will affect my nails and I need to immerse the nail beds of my fingers in an ice bucket to preserve them. Potentially my nails will flake and/or peel as well as darken. Definitely a different experience!
Many more meds this time to manage the side effects, of which these worked until Friday night - mid evening the fatigue and body aches really hit and the last 24hrs have been the hardest. Slowly the effects are reducing but it comes and goes, a burst of energy then a period of rest needed.
I am listening to my body, embracing those moments of energy when I can and taking it easy when I need to.

How you are all helping :)
26 April 2024
Posted by: Teresa Watson
This journey has taught me a lot already, not only about myself but also about the people that are our village. I knew we had amazing people as part of our life journey, but it is moments like these where our village's love wraps around us and reminds us how blessed we are to have these people here for us 🥰 You are all amazing and we love you all.
It's the smiles, the hugs the text message and messenger check-ins, the people who stop you on the street to say hi and the amazing gestures of kindness that are unexpected. I feel so grateful and blessed and at times in awe of the love myself and my family have received from you all.
Thank-you ❤️
The funds from this Givealittle page has meant I have been able to purchase and continue to purchase all the supplements I am using to support my health journey. I have started attending Kinesthesiology which will support me mentally and holistically through this journey too. My energy levels and fatigue has really started to affect what I can achieve around home and we have got in a regular private cleaner to help keep our house healthy and clean, reduce some of the physical and mental workload of life.
I am halfway through chemo now, the next 3 cycles are expected to be much harder than what I have experienced so far and I expect to need to take a break from working towards the end of the full series so I am in planning about that now. I also will meet with the radiation team end of May.
Thank-you all again for your support 🥰

3rd Chemo Done - Halfway now!
14 April 2024
Posted by: Teresa Watson
This week was my 3rd cycle of chemo, last cycle of the first half.
I am so grateful to my treatment company team, joining me for each treatment cycle, bringing snacks, cups of tea and chatting with me while the infusion is done. There are a few options for where to receive chemo: a range of private rooms and a main lounge area (fishbowl) as well as some consult rooms. The private rooms have recliner chairs and footstools. I am getting to know the nurses in the oncology day ward now and it is nice to see some familiar faces when I report back for the next infusion. I have had a lot more fatigue this time round so have spent more time recovering, taking it easy and keeping my food intake balanced. Less dizziness again this time but have experienced some new effects - big reduction in taste and super sensitivity to smells.
My next chemo is in 2 weeks time and is a different chemo type than the previous three so far. From what I understand, the new type can be a lot rougher on people, it is usually done second in the series due to it's effects and if I am to have a reaction it is likely to be with the second infusion of the three.
So glad to be halfway through the planned chemo journey! Later this month I expect to be contacted by the radiation team to discuss next steps after chemo. One step at a time

Week 2 of chemo, all done
24 March 2024
Posted by: Teresa Watson
This week I had my second cycle of chemo. Going into it a second time I had some reassurance and some nervousness of what to expect. I know the process of receiving it now and the nurses on the ward are just amazing, so fun to chat to and happy to answer any and all of my questions. I am so grateful for my village, I have people coming to my treatments with me for company and receive messages from people regularly checking in and seeing what I need, you are all amazing! Thank you so much ❤️
This cycle I have definitely felt more fatigued than previously; my body has needed more time to rest and recuperate. I don't feel hunger the same way anymore so it is important to keep my meals regular and focus on foods that are easy to prepare and digest. Thursday again was the day I felt most affected by treatment and I can see the trend now. Taking time and moving at my own pace is definitely a lesson I am learning. Enjoying more cuddles with my girls, savouring a cup of tea or sitting outside on our deck to hold space.
My hair has already begun to fall out, a lot faster than I had expected. Day 15 after my first cycle was the day it first began thinning and it hasn't let up. I still have quite a bit left for now but managing loose hairs is a new challenge. I wasn't expecting the itchiness and sensitivity of my scalp. My next step is to buzz it off so I can be more comfortable. Eva is keen as to help me out with the trimming process and she is very excited about my new hair look.

1st week of Chemo done
3 March 2024
Posted by: Teresa Watson
This week has been a busy one. On Tuesday 27th Feb I had my first session of chemo. After an initial education session where I was able to ask as many questions as I needed we started the process. It takes around 2 hours for all of the chemo to be administered and for the first part I am receiving three different types of chemo per session.
I realised I had misunderstood the approach to my sessions, instead of 18 sessions to break cycles up, I will only be having 6 sessions, each session a full cycle. This means only 5 more sessions to go till all done! I felt fine afterwards just a bit tired initially, then the full weight of exhaustion hit later that evening and I have never felt exhaustion like this, it is indescribable.
It is not like in the movies, anti-nausea meds manage things well and timing is critical, leave it too long and it would not be pleasant.
This has been a real learning curve for wee our family this week, I definitely have lower energy levels and having rests are key.
This is just the beginning, one step at a time

What's happening
20 February 2024
Posted by: Teresa Watson
Thank you so much for all your support everyone. I have been so humbled by the kind words, thoughts and generosity of spirit from you all. This journey can be so overwhelming and the hugs, chats and knowledge that you are all there helps xx
So where are things at, right now?
My recent CT and MRI scans were positive showing no signs of metastasis anywhere which means there is no visible signs of cancer spread. The tricky thing is because I had cancerous nodes that spread may still have happened but is not yet visible.
I am already engaging with a naturopath and met with my medical oncologist last week to consider the options available. The oncologist has recommend 6 cycles of chemotherapy, approx. 6 months of treatment - A cycle being 3 weeks of chemo treatment on one day of the week, with a one week gap between cycles. The list of possible side effects of the treatments are extensive, one of the recommended chemo types has 3 pages of possible side effects ranging from the standard well known effects of chemo to much more involved side effects. Chemo does destroy cancer cells but also destroys good cells in the body, destroying immunity which means I will become imminocompromised once I start treatment. My naturopath has recommended a number of different supplements to support cellular regrowth, boost immunity and support my health and wellbeing during treatment.
I start chemotherapy next week.

We are Heartbroken for our baby sister and would give anything to sit in her place🥺 Lavinia will undergo three rounds of chemotherapy, Day 1 yesterday, and this of course comes with many challenges, one being a financial strain.With this being a long and stressful journey, we are hoping to help Lavinia and her little family financially.

Hello everyone,
Lavi here once again! Just wanted to jump on and wrap up the page. As you all may be wondering I underwent my last cycle of Chemotherapy on the 15th April and I am now cancer free.
I just want to thank everyone once again for the undying love and support because I truly could not have done it without any of you guys.
Special mention to all my brothers and sisters, aunty’s and uncles. You guys know who you are but the biggest shout out to my little family and my mom. You guys were truly my light at the end of the tunnel and once again I could not have made any of this possible without you guys. Thank you for pushing me when I wanted to give up and most of all thank you so much for believing in me. I love you guys the most. Thanking the lord for everything. We are truly blessed. FOE.
Other than that, I am so proud of myself for getting through the biggest storm and coming out on top. I am currently on the road to recovery and I pray everyday that I may never need to experience that ever again.
Dear cancer,
There was times where I wanted to let you to take me but I did not. You broke me only for me to get back up again, you changed me only for me to become a better person. It was bittersweet but I am ready to leave you behind. Chapter closed.
Bye now family and friends. Thank you so much.

Lavinias letter x
28 February 2024
Posted by: Lavinia Daniela-Fatiaki
Hi everyone, Lavinia here x
Firstly I just wanted to express my absolute gratitude, love and appreciation. I just want to say thank you for everything! The love, the kindness, the support, the strength, the prayers, EVERYTHING. I do struggle to find the appropriate words for this letter but I know I am truly blessed. Due to all the love and support I will continue my fight to live with my head held high and the biggest smile on my face. Not only does it bring me pain and agony but it gives me strength and a daily reminder to be thankful and grateful for everything and anything this life may present itself with. As I congratulate myself for successfully completing my first week of chemotherapy I also encounter many other tough challenges. Day 10/63 and I’ve been through hell and back already. I was admitted into North shore hospital on Saturday morning due to severe side effects of chemotherapy. discharged Monday morning and went straight to chemo over at Auckland hospital. I’ve been home since Monday arvo learning how to control pain and nausea with all sorts of medication. searching for any alternative pain and anti nausea remedies to help me get through. Although times have been tough I’ve come out on top once again! Staying positive to live a longer better life.
Once again, thank you so much for all the Love and support you have showered me and my whanau with. We are truly blessed and thankful for each and everyone one of you. My heart is so warm, Amen.
Kindly Lavinia x

Donny had been feeling unwell a few days but was feeling well enough to travel and get home to NZ. Virgin Atlantic flight staff were not as convinced and thank God removed Donny and Red from what would have been a fatal flight home to find that he had Pneumonia which turned to sepsis and had already started spreading form his right lung affecting his internal organs and was now in a critical condition. They rushed him into ICU where he remained on a ventilator until his lungs were functioning on their own.
As you can imagine the financial burden of staying on in London has drained what was left of their honeymoon and emergency funds and coordinating insurance with doctors at home and london has been a nightmare and still to no avail.
Thanking God and the doctors that Donny is now well enough to be discharged tomorrow but must remain in London until he is given the all clear to fly with oxygen. They now have the daunting task of supporting themselves while they navigate the uncertainty of returning home over the next week or so with little to no funds left and insurance still delayed ontop of the overwhelmingness of being so far from home
They are not ones to ask for help or money but the first to give it, so Im asking for them and I know we as their community and family will wrap around them and help get them through this and home. Ahakoa he iti he pounamu.. any amount will help. Nga mihi x

On Tuesday the 16th of January he suffered further complications from a large stroke. This stroke has effected his ability to communicate through speech and he is currently unable to eat and drink. His mobility is also extremely limited.
Jim has already had a number of surgeries and these will be ongoing into the foreseeable future. He remains in a critically ill condition.
Due to the seriousness of his condition he is now expected to be at Middlemore Hospital National Burns Centre for many months. This creates a serious challenge for him and his family with being so far from home.

Hey All,
Jim would like to share an update with everyone. Firstly, he reached a major milestone and is now able to eat and drink, having gone over a month without being able to do this, Jim was rather happy to get to this stage.
This is just one of the many steps he has ahead of him on his road to recovery. The latest update on a timeframe is another 2-4 months to treat his burns, with further stroke rehabilitation after this.
Jim would once again like to thank everyone for their on going support and looks forward to sharing his progress in the future. He would like to share a photo of him learning how to play bridge online again!

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

Te Araroa is a 3008km through-hike the length of New Zealand. The main purpose was to raise funds to build a small eye clinic in Shinyanga, a remote part of Northern Tanzania. Shinyanga is hours away from the nearest eye care facility. All monies raised go to the cause with all professionals paying their own way.
About us
Eye Care for Africa was founded in 2017 by Hawkes Bay based Optometrist Niall McCormack. It was formed to provide real eye care to some of the most marginalised groups in the countries of Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Kenya. It all began when Niall accepted an invitation to provide eye care to an orphanage in Uganda. Whilst there it became very apparent of the dire level of need that existed.
This experience motivated Niall to make a difference and upon his return to New Zealand ‘Eye Care for Africa’ was created. The charity is now an official charity registered with the NZ Charities Commission.

This will be a teaching project helping to train selected local people to learn the basic skills of refraction. This will help with the sustainability of eye care in these regions.

Jeremy, firstly thank you so much for you amazing donation and apologies for the delay as I’ve been off-grid most of the time. We did try to get tax deduction for donations but as we mainly operate overseas it’s not been possible for a fledgling charity. We have been advised we can try again in the future once we have more of a track record. Currently in Bay of Islands and making good progress!
Thanks again for you donation!
Kind regards

Two weeks ago, Angela was diagnosed with Stage 3, triple negative breast cancer. Despite feeling blindsided by this news, she has been so incredibly brave and strong and is determined to beat cancer.
Angela is an amazing single mother to her three young sons and works hard to support herself and her boys.
She is an incredibly kind and generous friend who is always the first to help her friends with anything they need.
We want Ange to feel the same support she has selflessly given to so many others.
Any donations will go towards an unfunded treatment Ange has been offered- Pembrolizumab- Keytruda, at a cost of $100,000. This treatment will give Ange the best possible chance of the cancer not returning.
In addition, we would like Ange to be able to focus on her treatment and spending time with her boys without the financial stress of losing her income while unable to work.
Ange starts round 1 of chemotherapy this week, and it is unlikely she will be able to work during these 20 weeks of chemotherapy.
Following chemotherapy, she will then need to have surgery and radiation.
Any contributions will be hugely appreciated by Ange her boys, and her friends and family, thank you so much.

2 July 2024
Hi everyone, there have been some unexpected changes which we wanted to update you on. Unfortunately, Ange has been struggling with her health as a result of chemo and the immunotherapy treatments. She has had multiple hospital admissions due to almost zero immunity which create a whole range of problems. Her oncologist has directed her to stop the immunotherapy treatments (unfunded) as they are making her too unwell. Although this is not what Ange has wanted, there are positive results so far with chemo which is really great news. A BIG thank you to all those who have and continue to donate to this page. Although the treatment funds are no longer needed, this money goes towards the rising cost of living for Ange and her sons, holistic treatments and generally making life a little less stressful due to not being well enough to work. There is still a long way to go-halfway through chemo, then surgery and radiation. Ange continues this fierce battle to wellness for herself and her beautiful sons. Thank you again everyone I know Ange has been blown away by the genuine kindness of you all.

We were told one whole year ago, by our Plunket nurse, that Maisyn could potentially have a syndrome, and were referred to paediatrics twice and both times were declined. We were also referred to genetics twice, first time declined and then approved on the second time, but with an 11 month wait. It wasn't until we met with an ENT doctor who pretty much took one look at Maisyn and knew something wasn't quite right and urgently referred us to paediatrics. That was on the 18th of March this year and from then till now has been an absolute Rollercoaster of emotions.
We have the best support system ever and we couldn't do this without all of you, honestly.

And just like that... WE ARE HOME!!
After 32 days in hospital, day +21 post transplant, we got to leave and come home to comfort! We are so unbelievably proud of our girl, she has absolutely smashed this whole process, she has showed us just how absolutely strong she is and how much she can handle. She has blown everybody away, quoted a ""textbook transplant"" and all (majority of the time) with that beautiful smile on her face.
Don't get me wrong, there were extremely hard days, and it was very sad to see her so sick, but this will all be worth it to see her live a longer, more fulfilling life.
Maisyn, I hope you know how loved you are and how many people were cheering you on behind the scenes, and we appreciate all the genuine support and love!
We still have a long way to go, and we aren't out of the woods yet, but we take each day as it comes and if the last 32 days are to go by, she will smash whatever comes her way. Keep on keeping on my little warrior princess. Your mum and dad love you more than you can ever imagine

Day +14
4 June 2024
Day +14
The day has come to say goodbye to Maisyns hair - I was secretly holding on to hope that she wouldn't lose it, but started noticing yesterday that it was starting to come out in clumps and knew we had to bite the bullet and give her a buzz cut as the hair was EVERYWHERE!! So we waited for Dad to get here today, mum cut the ponytail off and then dad shaved it all off.
Pretty sad day, although I wasn't as upset as I thought I would be - I think I had already mentally prepared for this day a long time ago at the start of this journey.
She's still as gorgeous as ever, and it will grow back - who knows, it might even grow back curly!!
Her neutrophils continue to rise, today was sitting at 0.98 which is amazing for this early on!! She's doing amazing, still quite nauseous and has the occasional vomit, but overall gaining more and more strength and sassiness every day, even took a couple of steps today! 😍😍😍
Keep being amazing my little fighter

Day +5, +6, +7, +8, +9 and today day +10
Not much to report on from the last few days, very much uneventful which is what we want. Maisyn is still in quite a bit of pain, mainly when she has a bowel movement due to the mucositis, but they have reduced the continuous morphine she was getting and now we just push a button to give her a small amount when she's in pain. But overall doing really well.
Today (Day +10) her white blood cell count has started to increase which is a good sign, so hopefully by the end of this week we see an improvement!!
Not much else to report on, just taking each day as it comes at the moment and wait, wait, wait for those levels to rise 🥰🥰

How brave are you little one so proud of you and looking forward to seeing you run around again
Day +1 +2 +3 +4
24 May 2024
Day +1, +2, +3, +4
Maisyn has been doing extremely well! She was in quite a lot of pain earlier in the week and so our main goal was just to get that pain under control so she was comfortable which we have managed to do, so our days have been pretty uneventful, which is good!! She's just been very sleepy and resting lots which her little body needs.
She had to have a blood transfusion on Monday as her haemoglobin levels came down quite a lot, but that is all very normal and to be expected, with more to come probably!
Very hard seeing our little girl not her usual bubbly self but we know it's not forever and she will be back to our sassy girl in no time.

Day 0
18 May 2024
Day 0 - cord blood infusion day!
The day has finally come for Maisyn to get her new cells and start a new journey! Mixed emotions and feeling all the feels today.
Maisyn has been doing well, she has been a lot more sleepy and grumpy the last couple days, could be the start of mucositis which is a side effect from the chemo and can be very painful so she is on pain relief but still in relatively good spirits when she is up and awake.
We've been told the next week or two will be the worst in terms of pain for Maisyn as this is when we will start to see the side effects from the chemo, so giving her all the snuggles to keep her happy. Now we just wait for those new cells to start growing!!! All the positive vibes our way please!!

Was International MPS Awareness Day Yesterday
16 May 2024
It is International MPS awareness day today, but what's really sad is that I can't find anything in NZ about this day or it being ""celebrated"" here 😔 so here I am, trying to bring more awareness to anyone this will reach.
MPS are rare genetic disorders in children and adults caused by the absence of a specific enzyme.
In Maisyns specific case, she has MPS I otherwise known as Hurler Syndrome which is a rare disease in which the body is missing or does not produce enough of an enzyme needed to break down long chains of sugar molecules. As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.
When Maisyn was first diagnosed, she had to undergo so many tests to see what damage had already been done to her body and to make sure that we could proceed with the treatment, chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant, which she is currently undergoing.
Both Ryan and I carry a copy of this ""broken"" gene and there is a 1 in 4 chance of having a child with this syndrome.
Maisyn is the most amazing, strong, resilient, cheeky, sassy, independent little girl and we would not change her for the world. She has taught us so much in her short little life and will teach us so much more along the way. I couldn't be more proud to be her mum and as much as I wish we didn't have to go through all of this, we are all going to be so much stronger for it.
Love you baby girl, more than you'll ever know. 🩷🩷🩷

Maisyn has now finished her four rounds of ATG
13 May 2024
Maisyn has now finished her four rounds of ATG and this afternoon will start the chemo drugs. She's done so well, fever on the first night, slight one on the second night, puffy red eyes, little bit of a rash, some wafts of oxygen when sleeping and a bit tired and grumpy, but overall relatively non eventful. Super proud of her. She has now had a nasal gastric tube fitted as she was refusing to take her oral meds, and even though it is a visual reminder of her sickness, it means we don't have to fight her on the daily just to give her the meds she needs and soon she will also lose her appetite and will need to have her nutrition through this tube. Super proud to be her mum, keep fighting my little brave one.
Also, happy mothers day to all the mums out there! I hope you all have the most amazing day and make sure you hug your little ones extra tight!!! ❤️❤️

I’m so proud of you little one you are so brave and strong god bless you and your family love and support to you maisyn
The treatment starts
9 May 2024
(Day 0 is cord blood infusion day)
Maisyn had her first round of ATG which is an immunosuppressant drug that reduces the T cells which in turn helps prevent graft rejection and also graft vs host disease.
She did so so so well, I'm so proud of her. She hasn't reacted at all, had a very slight temperature at one check but that came down at the next check and we are now done for the day! She had a slight moment during the day where she was quite upset and grumpy but I think she was just extremely tired as we were up before 5am this morning!! A quick nap on mum and she was good to go. Couldn't ask for day one to go any better! Long road to go, but all we can do is think positively!

Hickman line Operation
2 May 2024
Maisyn had her Hickman line put in today under general anaesthetic and they also removed one of her ovaries to preserve it for the future should she choose to have children one day, as the chemo drugs are really strong. She's recovering well and is now having her second round of Enzyme replacement therapy. It's been a long day for all of us. Back in to hospital next week to start the chemo and we will be in hospital full time for 6-8 weeks. Still such a happy wee gal after everything 😍

Maisyn's Cup
30 April 2024
Just a quick update from the weekend. The Counties RC Club held a race meeting on Sunday in support of Maisyn. They donated all funds made on the day to help Maisyn. We are very grateful for all that they done on the day, fun was had by all and Maisyn really enjoyed her time down at the track. She loved watching the cars going around the track. The Nelson RC Club also raised funds at their race meeting on Sunday and donated on this page thank you so much for your generosity.
There was also a sign made by Graeme McDougal which was auctioned off

Tuesday Update
24 April 2024
First enzyme replacement therapy done! What a long, long day. Maisyn did so well!!
We are coming back in to the hospital next week to meet with the Bone Marrow Transplant team to go over the ins and outs of the treatment and to see the ward etc and then also back in for them to put a central line in her chest/neck for the chemo and for any other meds/enzyme replacement therapy to go through while we're staying long term at the hospital. Then all going well she will start chemo the following week.
It's all go go go and very overwhelming but super glad it's all being done quickly.
Also, found out her donor match was found in Spain, how cool?!
Rock on my little superstar ✨️ love you so much 🩷

Disappointing start to the week, we drove to the hospital bright and early this morning for Maisyns first Enzyme Replacement Therapy, only to get there and be told that the medication had not arrived at the hospital yet and no one had called me on Friday to let me know... so back in again tomorrow 🙄🙄 super frustrating. But it is what it is. Maisyns still happy as with not a care in the world 😂 💕

First steps to treatment
11 April 2024
Hello everyone, little update from us. Yesterday Maisyn had a cognitive assessment done, they advised us they don't normally do these assessments on kids as young as Maisyn so not too expect too much from it but they could get some sort of baseline from it to be able to assess her post transplant.
Today we were back in the hospital bright and early, firstly for an ultrasound on her liver and spleen which are enlarged due to the syndrome, and then she underwent surgery to remove her tonsils and adenoids and to insert grommets. She is recovering very well, she is in PICU overnight just to monitor her breathing/oxygen and then will have another night on the ward tomorrow. She is doing great though, making everyone smile and laugh 🥰🥰

Help With Rhiannon’s Medical Bills,My friend Rhiannon needs support for medical care while suffering severe ME/CFS,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/0c5431f1-6030-4ea5-b1bc-b15300c5a831-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/help-with-rhiannons-medical-bills,8705.0,15000.0,82 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/help-with-rhiannons-medical-bills,6 Oct 2023,24 Sep 2024,0,Wellington,127,"UPDATE: Rhiannon has found this a huge help and been able to find some very specific areas of support needed. Its been determined that she has been negatively affected by mycotoxins and so future funding will go to:
1) ERMI testing (a type of DNA-based testing that uses Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values to identify mold levels in a given area.) (approx. $1,265)
2) Remediation.
3) Upgrade ventilation system to prevent environment re-growing mold. (approx. $8,000)
4) Treatment protocol to try clear biotoxins and imbalances in her system.
My super awesome pal Rhiannon has been bedridden for well over a year with severe myalgic encephalomyelitis. She developed this when she was 11 and spent years on and off bedridden but always recovered to the point where she could slowly achieve things but with physical consequences. However now she is severely affected to the point where all she can do is play on her phone. It affects every aspect of her health and life and makes her extremely susceptible to outside illnesses meaning she can’t go to hospital due to risk and needs private doctor care and extra finances to get things like medical supplies, supplements and if the house itself is contributing (harmful molds) potentially looking at renovations. Literally any little bit will help out and mean that we can see our friend again.
Euan Towns-Lindroos' involvement (page creator)
Rhiannon is a dear friend of mine and currently due to the nature of illness we cannot visit or help physically so our friends want to set up a way to help remotely.
Use of funds
The main focus is to get extra support for a health watch, private doctor visits as there are no specialists available, potential adjustments to house and living, and ongoing medicine costs. Funds will be paid to Rhiannon's brother Jordan Ansell.","The main focus is to get extra support for a health watch, private doctor visits as there are no specialists available, potential adjustments to house and living, and ongoing medicine costs.

Posted by: Jen Germano
Apologies for the radio silence, it's been a crazy six months of chemo. Probably one of the hardest things I've ever done. I've never felt so sick in my life and trying to take care of two little people when I was feeling at my worst has been quite the challenge. Three months ago I felt like I was dying and it felt like the end of chemo would never come.... But here I am. Three weeks ago I had my last dose of chemo and it was my turn to ring the bell in the chemo clinic - signalling the end of this first part of my cancer treatment. It felt a bit bittersweet, so proud of myself to get this far and so sad for the amazing women I've met along the way who will never get to ring the bell. It was a day of mixed emotions.
And now I'm feeling the best I have in months- which is still a lifetime away from my pre cancer life. But trying to make the most of this short window of reprieve. Dog walks outside with friends, birthday celebrations for Noah, and a weekend at an eco resort/spa with my girlfriends... But time is running out and next Thursday I'm heading in for a mastectomy and removal of my lymph nodes and then back into recovery mode again.
Once again I just wanted to say thank you to all you amazing people and for all your support and to all the friends here in Nelson who have helped me in the kids- there is no way I could have done this without you all!!! Cancer is not something you can fight alone so thank you, from the bottom of my heart ❤️💕❤️

Posted by: Jen Germano
I won't lie, the last week or so has been pretty tough. The main tumor has continued to shrink (yay!!!) but my body is being to struggle after nearly three months of intense weekly chemo treatments. Last week I was getting light headed, struggling to breathe and to walk a couple hundred metres to pick up my kids, freezing cold, etc etc. My good friend Ruth took me to hospital on Thursday and other amazing friends pitched in on the kid front. My blood counts were starting to drop. I went in for chemo on Monday and they checked again but everything was continuing to decline so they sent me home without chemo as my haemoglobin, platelets and neutrophils were all low and not on a good trajectory. Yesterday I was back at the hospital for the day for a blood transfusion. Feeling better today- but better is a relative term ☺️ just a week and a half ago before I crashed, I had gone for an easy river paddle with my kids. Not feeling up to paddling at the moment but the fact that I can go to the grocery store and do jobs around the house feels amazing. Hopefully the mini break from chemo and the transfusion will also mean I can enjoy the Easter holidays with my boys as well. And thanks to all you amazing people, I came home from the hospital yesterday to a clean house, beds with fresh sheets and laundry folded- having a cleaner has been a luxury and a godsend. ☺️

Chemo is continuing to work!!

Posted by: Jen Germano
Good news from my oncology appointment today- tumors are continuing to shrink! The main one which was almost 9 cm at the start and 4 cm three weeks ago is now 2 x 2.5 cm! Yay! Still a long way to go as far as my treatment plan, but it's continuing to work 😊 🤞😊
Thank you to everyone who has helped - with meals, with kids, stuff around the house and at the hospital, messages, and give a little donations. I'm am so very grateful for you all! I could never manage this alone. 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻. You guys are amazing!

Hi, Jen. We're glad to hear that the chemo is working. I hope you're weathering it relatively OK. Lots of love from Ecuador! Roy & Laurie
Keep it up, Jen!
17 February 2024
This woman. Honestly.
You don't often get medals for being stoic, but Holy hecka - Jen deserve a big ol crown for her incredible attitude.
On Tuesday, Jen got a port in so she can revieve treatments with less trauma and so she can be hands free! Jen is still deciding if it was a good idea - but hey it means hands free mode is enabled!
Jens life at the moment revolves around hospital visits, procedures, and her boys - and that's rough for someone who loves her job and her outdoor things, and is getting knocked around by chemo.
I just wanted to say your generosity has been so appreciated - helping with the financial burden is something tangible that we can all share, when we are so helpless to help in other ways. If you are able to donate, please do.

Chemo is working!!!
3 February 2024
Posted by: Jen Germano
🤣 so this is what chemo looks like- thank god we had our buzz cut party last week! I'd have to call a plumber if I still had long hair! Logan has been pointing out the emerging bald spots throughout the day, so I'll go from the GI Jane look to bald fairly soon I think...
But on a positive note...lost hair means the chemo is working and my nearly 9 cm tumor has now shrunk to 4.5 cm after the first cycle of 3 once-a-week treatments 💕💕💕🫶🏻👏🏻 the oncologist couldn't even feel the tumors in my lymph nodes this week. Still have at least 5 more months of chemo, multiple surgeries and radiation to go (none of that changes as there is a chance the cancer cells have spread elsewhere in my body and I need the best chance of killing everything to lower my risk of reoccurrence in the future)... But off to a good start!
Thank you again to everyone who has donated here. I would love to thank you all personally at some point but my energy levels this last month have been pretty low since starting chemo- it's all I can do to keep up with kids and the necessities of life (even then, the dinner dishes are usually waiting for me in the morning now 🙂)...but just know that I've read all your messages and I'm so very grateful for all your support of me and my boys!!!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!! Ngā mihi nui!!! 💕💕🫶🏻💕💕 -Jen

It was a bit inevitable....2 1/2 weeks into chemo and my hair started falling out. So instead of waiting for it to clog up my drain, some amazing friends helped me turn it into a party with our kids. 8 shaved heads, some party food and a ""f**k cancer"" cake that Logan has been waiting all week to make 🙂. I really can't thank everyone enough... I truly am blessed to be surrounded by such awesome friends and family.

Kia ora koutou, just a little update. Had my first round of chemotherapy on Friday. Despite the hiccups with Covid ruining my initial family support plans, amazing friends stepped in to help save the day and all went well. The combination of chemo and the pile of drugs to manage the side effects have left me tired and a bit exhausted the last three days. A few minor other dramas but overall doing well. Have even managed a little yoga at the beach, a dog walk with my mum along the Maitai (she's still covid negative but not staying at my house), and a tiny bit of gardening (which was not too overwhelming due to some amazing gardening working bees from friends). a cleaner [is coming] to come help me out a bit once a fortnight starting Tuesday thanks to the generosity of everyone who donated via Give A Little- will definitely make life a little bit easier this year. A few more weeks to hopefully enjoy having hair before it all falls out ☺️ but right now just so incredibly grateful for all the amazing people in my life. Ngā mihi nui koutou!!!

9 January 2024
..""to my friends/family who sent countless messages and donated so generously (I definitely had some tears in my eyes when I opened it the other day), for help with my kids and the dog, and for those of you who came camping/tramping/backpacking/paddling to bring a little normality to life and get me thinking of other things, for all the friends that reached out with their own stories and words of encouragement, for all the planning chats, and to my parents who have flown out to NZ and will be here for my first couple chemo rounds..from the bottom of my heart thank you so much to all of you. 💕
This is going to be a hard year, but knowing that I have such an amazing group of people and love for me and the boys makes an awful situation a bit less scary and I know I will get through it with such an amazing village around me. I know I'm not alone. Definitely going to be a marathon, not a sprint.
I have stage 3 triple negative breast cancer. I'm looking at 6 months of chemo (weekly for the first half), surgery and potentially multiple ones (need to do genetic tests but likely that I have the gene for it hence possibly multiple surgeries), and radiation which I'll have to leave home for a month for (probably Wellington). The scans have shown that it hasn't spread past my breast and lymph nodes yet, so the prognosis for beating this is good....and hopefully new years eve 24 I'll be in a much better place than this past one.
1st round of chemo starts on Friday, so here we go..

It has spread to her lung and liver. Brenda’s journey has been marked by resilience and courage, despite numerous setbacks.
The road to diagnosis was long and difficult, seeking answers from medical providers but left with frustration when met with no answers. The symptoms continued to get more severe, then a colonoscopy finally revealed cancer months down the track. Valuable time lost.
In April of last year, Brenda began treatment. An incident during chemotherapy resulted in the treatment entering her tissue instead of her vein. This experience left Brenda with PTSD, making it incredibly hard to continue with the chemotherapy.
Brenda’s oncology team has recommended a course of Avastin alongside the chemotherapy she has resumed. This treatment is unfunded in New Zealand - costing $5,000 per session (plus expenses), but offers her the best chance of recovery.
The financial burden of this pathway is overwhelming. Your support can make a profound difference in Brenda's life. She has faced the loss of one of her sons, her remaining children & 2 mokos need her to succeed in this fight. By contributing, you can give Brenda the opportunity to be there for her family.

My name is Phoebe and my father arrived in New Zealand under the visit visa category. Prior to leaving the Philippines, he had medical checkups and his 2D echo was normal. Due to their age, we decided to get medical insurance for him and my mom. However, before even having the insurance approval, he had a cardiac arrest. We were able to revive him with a series of CPR before the ambulance arrived and he was brought to the hospital alive. Later on, they found out that all of his major heart arteries are completely blocked and damaged.
He has been in the hospital for almost two weeks now and needs to undergo a life-saving open-heart surgery at the end of this month. The estimated cost of the surgery is $120,000-$150,000 NZD. While we are doing our very best to arrange these fees, we really do hope you can give us a little support of any amount.

I suffer from severe pain, dislocating joints, constant nausea and vomiting plus fainting and seizures. For years, doctors have dismissed my symptoms, leaving me without medical care or treatment. Without medical help, my condition will continue to deteriorate, limiting further my already very limited life.
But there's a glimmer of hope, I've finally received a diagnosis for my mystery illness. I have Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (HEDs) and Abdominal Vascular Compression Syndromes (AVCs). These conditions are the underlying cause for my symptoms.
Fortunately, AVCS can be treated with surgery to improve my symptoms, however as AVCS are very rare this surgery is unavailable in NZ. This means I have to self-fund the huge cost to undergo surgery in Germany. Without this surgery, my life will continue to be limited due to my symptoms.
Financially, things are difficult, I’ve supported myself since I was 16. I'm studying vet nursing, doing volunteer work, and working a cleaning job but due to my ill health, my ability to study and work has been severely limited. Unfortunately, I don't have family support to fall back on.
I'm incredibly grateful for anything you donate. If you're unable to contribute financially, sharing my story with your networks would also make a huge difference. Thank you so much for your kindness and support. If I can't raise enough funds for the surgery, every donation will go toward my ongoing medical care.

17 April 2024
Unfortunately over the last month or so my condition has rapidly deteriorated, leaving me dependant on a feeding tube and a port in my chest to sustain my nutrition and hydration. I am unable to continue working in the job I had, and I have had to leave my Vet Nursing studies. I am still looking for a job that is more suited around my health, however the costs that arise from my health have made things incredibly difficult for me.
It has been confirmed that my only option to have any relief from the most severe symptoms I experience is surgery. Currently my only option for surgery is in Germany, at the total cost of $160-180k. This is an impossible cost to meet alone for a surgery that is needed now more than ever before.
It has been an incredibly difficult and challenging journey, but in the meantime I am continuing with my volunteer work, and just taking each day as it comes as until I am one day able to have surgery. I am incredibly greatful for all the support and any donations that have been made so far. I couldn't have made it this far without it.

Diagnosis & Surgery
30 December 2023
Please read my ""newly edited"" page. I have finally found out what is causing my illness and after tests, I have received two diagnoses from specialists here in NZ and Germany: I have hEDS and AVCs . These specialists say that the hEDS and AVCs are causing my awful symptoms. Thank you so much for all your donations that have helped me finally figure this out after being sick for 4 years! I will now begin trying to fundraise for AVCs decompression surgery in Germany to help relieve some of my debilitating symptoms. If I am able to undergo surgery, it would hopefully mean I start getting some of my life back. Although still a long journey from here, I couldn't have got this far without your donations to help me access specialists. If you could please share my new updated page with your networks to help me achieve funds for surgery, it would be much appreciated. I hope I can start getting my life back soon.
Thank you, Kai.

Diagnosis
15 October 2023
Dear supporters,
I’m incredibly grateful for your ongoing support and generosity towards my medical tests. I wanted to give an update to tell you all how thankful I am and to let you know that I have begun the necessary steps to get a diagnosis. I have been lucky enough that Kiwis Together charity helped me to pay for an appointment with a leading Ehlers Danlos specialist in Auckland- Fraser Burling and he has diagnosed me with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS). hEDS Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a genetic connective tissue disorder. This disorder causes many different significant issues that explain lots of my symptoms. The next stage for me now is to send scans to Germany of my abdomen to check for a rare complication of hEDS called abdominal vascular compression syndrome AVCs which is very serious.
Your contributions have had a significant impact, both financially and emotionally. I will keep you updated and I’m so grateful for your presence on this journey. Thank you

I am reaching out with a heavy heart to ask for your support for our dear friends, Brooke and Blake, who are bravely facing a life-altering challenge. Recently, Brooke was diagnosed with a Stage 4 Glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumour in the right parietal lobe, leading to sensory and mobility changes to the left side of her body following surgery.
On April 24th, Brooke underwent a craniotomy to remove the tumour. While the surgery was a crucial step in her fight, it has left her with new challenges and a long road to recovery ahead. Brooke is now preparing for chemotherapy and radiation treatments, with more details expected from her oncologists in the coming days.
Throughout this process, Brooke has remained incredibly positive and brave. Her strength and resilience are truly inspiring. Brooke is a thoughtful and giving person, always there for others. Now, it’s our turn to support her and Blake.
Amidst this overwhelming journey, Brooke and Blake are facing financial pressures. Despite the emotional and physical toll, Blake has continued to work while trying to secure government assistance, which has been difficult and frustrating.
We are coming together to help ease their burden, allowing them to focus on what truly matters: Brooke’s health and their journey towards recovery.

We are truly overwhelmed by the generosity and support Blake and Brooke have received. We never could have imagined the incredible unity their community has shown in rallying behind Brooke. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your donations.
I recently received an update from Brooke and Blake, and they wanted to share this message: ""We have been overwhelmed by everyone’s generosity and are eternally grateful for all the support. Your kindness has brought us immense relief and hope during this challenging time.""
This week, Brooke had her first consultation with the oncologist, which brought them immense relief. He is a fantastic specialist who provided valuable information on holistic therapies, diet, and additional medications to enhance Brooke’s treatment.
Brooke will begin her radiation and chemotherapy treatments next week. She will undergo chemotherapy for 5 days each month over the next 6 months. Additionally, she will have MRI and CT scans to monitor her healing and plan her radiation treatment, which will be 5 days a week for 6 weeks.
Brooke has shown incredible strength and determination. She is doing everything she can as recommended by her oncologist, cutting out caffeine, alcohol, and sugar, and adopting a keto diet.
Your support has made a significant difference in easing their journey. Thank you for standing by Brooke and Blake during this challenging time.
With heartfelt gratitude,

He has had a harder journey than most in the health department. Diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) when he was a baby, and defeating the odds and surviving to the amazing person he is today.
David has 3 beautiful children. Mya (9), and twin boys Finn and Max (20months).
David underwent an emergency double lung transplant in 2019 when his health was at his lowest. He had 3 amazing years, even worked as a courier driver delivering your packages! He was on top of the world, being well and able. Things took a turn this year… when he started feeling short of breath. A feeling he hadn’t felt for almost 3 years. A few weeks passed and his health declined, with our first trip this year to Auckland hospital. Showed a lung infection, they tried treating the infection but it was unsuccessful and lead to acute rejection of his donor lungs.
Back to hospital for planned infusions/transfusions of the antibodies causing the rejection. 7 days into treatment he suffered a serious setback. He contracted sepsis which quickly turned into septic shock. We went from having a plan, to saying our goodbyes. With such a low survival rate, we were told to prepare ourselves. To all the families surprise David stats improved! Hope for survival slowly crept in. Spending 50 days in hospital, learning to walk and eat again.
While we wait for new lungs we could do with some help from you guys.

5 June 2024
David’s asked me to write another update.
Waiting is hard, every phone call from a private number gets the heart racing. He has been on the Auckland telemarking list lately and had multiple calls.
Since our last update and consequently on our anniversary David had a major set back. He had a collapsed lung. Which took us to ED at hutt hospital. They later transferred him to Wellington hospital where he spent a week there. With hopes that the lung would inflate on its own. By day 3 they didn’t want to wait anymore and provided bedside surgery inserting a drain. I watched the procedure and held his hand through it, listening to the sound of the air trapped in the cavity surrounding his lung hiss out while they put the tube in. Many days at the hospital with daily chest X-rays hoping that it would inflate. It did! David was emailing the Auckland team to advise if he would still be on the list. They replied the next day to say yes. At this point he was very weak and feared the worst and that it was all over. He couldn’t move stand or breathe well after. I’ve dropped days at work to be home to help get his strength up and his chonnie his sister helps they days I am at work.
We a due a trip to Auckland on the 13th June to go through the tests again to assess his strength surviving the surgery and remaining in the list.
The funds that were raised, majority went on a car to fit all the kids and David’s wheel chair as our others are giving up on us.
Praying for a call.

Recent Hospital Visit
14 March 2024
Overnight visit to Greenlane and Auckland city hospital for the 3monthly tests.
These were the tests
- Bloods
- 6 minute walk
- Echo (cardiac ultrasound)
- Lung Function
- Clinic
The bloods showed an elevation in his kidney function. You need healthy kidneys to survive transplant. This is okay for now, they have lowered one of his meds for now to see if that makes a change.
The 6 minute walk test. He made it all 6 minutes. The last 2 and a half minutes he can’t remember as his O2 levels dropped to 88 from 97. But he made it all the way and managed 377 metres in 6 minutes we were aiming for 400. They say 350 is the new cutoff at this point so he did well here.
- his Echo on his heart was clear
- lung function has gone down 3% to 23%
Great news is that we are still on the list.
The next test is in 3 months. We pray for the call before then, things just seem to be declining.
David wants to still live his life, but is worried about the financial impact it would have. He wants to go see great white sharks, and fish on a charter and travel New Zealand while he can still walk.
I’ve told him not to worry about the house, cars, or financials we will make that happen.
So next step is to work on the bucket list and tick off the things he has always wanted to do.
I have so much love and respect for him, he deserves a full life. Full of love, happiness, and amazing memories.
I’ll carry the oxygen, let’s go!!!

Hospital Appointment 3 month check up
11 March 2024
Tomorrow we fly to Auckland from Wellington to meet with the respiratory doctors.
This visit is to be every 3 months as usual. They do a range of tests to check lung function and bloods results to keep an eye on his kidneys and liver while waiting for transplant. They have him doing a new test called a cardiac ultrasound. The most nerve racking test is the 6 minute walk. He can barely walk to the kitchen while on oxygen without losing his breath. He needs to achieve at least 400metres in 6 minutes with good O2 stats to still be considered for transplant and remain on the list.
We stay positive. With a few moments of doubt and anxiety.
After these tests on Wednesday we will know more and will post as update.

94 Days and counting
18 February 2024
David and I want to thank everyone who has donated so far to our family. The response has been so heart warming. Thank you to all that have shared our givealittle page and all your kind messages.
Update on David. He has been on the wait list for 94 days. Since we created this page David is now on oxygen 16 hours a day. The hospital organised a wheelchair for us so I can push him around and keep his life as normal as possible.
He is struggling with normal day to day tasks and has to limited himself with what he is able to do.
If the worst had happened back in June he would not be here to witness his cousins amazing 50th in Hamilton, or his best friends wedding.
Since then we have celebrated his 38th birthday, been to family Christmas, celebrated the twins 2nd birthday and Myas 9th birthday and spent Valentine’s Day together. February has been a busy month.
We are due another visit early march to Auckland hospital to do his checkup tests, these will tell us if he can still be on the wait list or if he is too sick for transplant. We will worry about that when we get there. For now we are grateful for everyday while we wait by the phone.

Immunotherapy is a privately-funded treatment which gives mum the most amazing odds at fighting the cancer (a 50% chance) but it is very costly in New Zealand. Mum has been able to fund the first set of treatments on her own with the support of close family, and the latest scans show that the treatment is working. The tumours are shrinking and calcifying, which is the best news our family could hope for during this difficult time.
This is where we need your support. Giving a little (even $5) would help mum with the rest of the 2 year immunotherapy treatment and hopefully give her at least 5 more years with her loved ones.

Hello all,
We wanted to share a little update for those following our beautiful Mum's cancer journey and the impact your love, positive support and generous donations has made to our family.
In October, we had the most devastating news that mum's cancer was terminal with a 6-8 month life expectancy. Mum was given the option to undergo immunotherapy, which had good odds of extending mum's life to 5+ years, however it is not publicly funded and is costly. This is where we turned to friends and family for support, and we are so grateful.
With your support with funding for immunotherapy, we have been able to cover the cost of the treatment. The treatments have continued and after her recent PET scan, we received incredible news that several of mum's tumours have shrunk or disappeared entirely. This is most amazing news we could have ever hoped for and we're truly grateful for all your support, love and generosity. It means the world to us.
As a result, mum has been given the most precious gift, the gift of time - time to make memories with her family and friends, be with precious grandchildren and to see our sister Kaela, get married to the love of her life, Matt, on the most beautiful day on Narrow Neck Beach.
Mum is still undergoing treatment and not completely out of the woods yet, still navigating treatment side-effects and fatigue however we know with her strength, positivity and light, her healing journey will continue 🤍🤍🤍
We are so very proud ✨️

Ok so after 2 previous dates for surgery ware bumped (dbl surgical booking for the 2nd surgeon and Covid) today is the day!
Just dropping Aja off to have her reconstructive surgery.
As she literally just said in a group chat we have with her mum:
“Man I am so ready to calm my tits and not just my tit”
So spirits are high, and it’ll only be a long day for those of not unconscious 😅
What this does mean is 6-12 weeks of rehab and off work.
Send love, come visit, In a week or so wee walks and coffees and reasons to get up and be mobile.. (pick ups needed unless I am free for drop offs for a bit cos healing)
But we look forward to seeing people and powering through this!
8-12 weeks more of no income is scary (one more moderate surgical session after this one to reduce the healthy breast to match but this one is tougher in the system as it is the DIEP Flap procedure (look it up if you want more details)
Love the surgeon, so glad to be able to use Mercy Hospital for recovery (thank you Southern Cross) and bittersweet that a beloved reason for even having insurance is unable to be here for this part.
Love you all.

The procedure for those that want to know is called a DIEP flap. Very similar to the traditional Tram Flap procedure but this does not remove any of the stomach muscles, leaving a much better healing result for the donor area and a less invasive recovery time.
Still, going to be anywhere from 8-12 hours under anaesthetic and then 3-5 days in Mercy again.
That will again be followed with home & bed rest for 6-8 weeks while both surgical areas heal.
Oddly I’m glad we’ve done all the wound drain stuff before so there’s nothing to fear except a stupid giant puppy who is going to be unable to pile onto Mum in the mornings for a while. 😜
As always, I’m just inspired by Aja’s work ethic and drive.
Surgeon asked her to reduce her BMI a little and overall weight for the surgery, and she has diligently done everything asked of her by her nutrition and gym support system (major thanks to Bella, Lynette, Bruno and the rest of The Wellness Gym ❤️🫂❤️)
If there’s any updates after today’s appointment I’ll post them but just wanted to loop you all in.
Aroha Nui ❤️

Back once again..
2 February 2024
So.. Hi everyone!
Time for some more updates.
Aja finally has her next surgery scheduled - reconstruction of the removed breast.
March 22nd! Which means birthday in hospital and a further 8 weeks of recovery and no work..
I swear the stress of treatment and recovery is as much of a pressure as the illness itself.
I’m sitting in the waiting room while Aja has her CT Scan for the pelvic region where they are taking the “donor skin” for her DIEP Flap reconstruction. Using the full terms so you can search and see the actual procedure for those that are so inclined.
The plastic surgeon doing the operation is awesome. She’s Irish, empathetic and genuinely invested in the best outcome for Aja!
We love you all, as always there is no expectation of giving but anything is welcome and greatly appreciated.

New Year.. New Challenges
8 January 2024
So it’s now 2024 and we’re still here and we’re still making headway into Aja’s journey of recovery.
1-2 days of work have been more than enough for Aja’s energy levels through this part of the journey; she’s also managing to get to the gym and do physical therapy and recovery of fitness stuff as she prepares for 2 more surgeries this year.
Shit she’s so determined and strong.
It blows me away how she just gets on with it.
We lost our Ginger Cat Leonidus to cancer and 6 weeks later Hoshiko our German Shepherd to a ruptured Spleen.. that took as big a toll as anything this past 6 months!
We have welcomed a new pupper Vincent into our world to help with the healing and loss and to give Aja a big walking buddy as she continues her fitness rehabilitation too.
There’s so many thanks to give to people and it feels weird leaving it so long to do an update.
Thank you all for being amazing and supportive and it is humbling to feel loved like this.
We hope that soon we can get back off one and a bit incomes again, but more than that, we hope to just be living normal healthy happy lives.
Check ya boobies.
The life you save may be your own ❤️

RADIATION ☢️ DONE ✅
4 June 2023
So, the active treatment stage of Aja’s cancer is currently complete.
3 weeks of daily treatments all done and dusted, huge thanks to the Dunedin Public Hospital Oncology Radiation Staff ♥️
Current ongoing treatment:
Bone Density work
Hormonal Treatment
Upcoming; oncology check ins, re testing to make sure all the greeblies are gone.
Surgical Check in to look at possible options around other full or partial mastectomy and reconstruction options.
The journey is long, tiring, mentally and physically exhausting.
So much admiration and care to all who ever deal with this.
Having a positive prognosis from the outset has been a phenomenal help.
I implore you, get health insurance, do regular self checks, if you are at all concerned DO NOT WAIT; get lumps and changes checked.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

The Catch Up-to-date including a Covid Plot Twist
21 May 2023
So it’s been about 5-6 weeks since I posted here.. maybe even longer.. sorry!
The weeks have very much blurred and rolled into one.
Since I last shared quite a bit has happened!
I’ll do this in chronological order to keep it easy to follow.
AJA FINISHED CHEMO!
20 weeks of chemo finally came to and end and while that in and of itself was a huge victory, it really marks about 1/4-1/3 of the journey..
About a week to 10 days after chemo was finished, Aja had the chemo-port (her Borg addition) removed from her chest too.
RADIATION TREATMENT
Has begun, getting to meet the radiation team at Oncology in the Dunedin Public Hospital was great, and luckily Aja was able to be booked in -retry swiftly after she finished her bouts of Chemo.
(Mercy doesn’t have this facility, and the only other option would have involved Aja travelling to Christchurch for 3 weeks alone and staying at Daffodil House)
You may have seen the ODT articles I shared about the state of Radiation Services in Dunedin so we were very fortunate, we know not everyone has been so lucky w the timing of their access.
Radiation is 3 weeks of daily sessions, this takes place in a machine that takes a mini CT scan every time it is used, and Aja breathes through a snorkel to create more separation between her heart and the area being radiated.
It’s very daunting parking and walking into perhaps the most mundane grey building in the hospital. There is a weight that hangs in spaces like this.. a tension of palpable consciousness.. this is a place where people have two extremely diverse outcomes.. it’s either being used to shrink cancer pre surgery in a hope it’s operable or it’s to help wrap up treatment and tie of loose ends like in our case..
those who are hoping for the former, have an understandable graveness to them.
The solemn reality is a reminder of the preciousness of life, I feel so blessed to be a passenger on the other journey.
The staff have all been exceptional, friendly, bubbly professionals who like at Manaaki, genuinely care for the well-being of their patients.
BONE DENSITY TREATMENT & DENTISTRY
This is a whole new player for us. One of the side effects of the ongoing (Multi Year) hormone treatment that Aja is now receiving due to the hormonal triggers for her cancer cells is that her literal bone density is likely to lessen, so for the next 2 years she will be on a mini chemo treatment for that. (Regular top up visits to Manaaki for this, so it’s at least a crew we know so we’ll already)
The biggest drawback to this is that Aja has had to initiate a cleaning and full dental review w her dentists (The amazing team at Smart Dental 🦷) as once she begins this treatment it will be 7 (Not a typo) years before she can be seen again.
So now, in the middle of all of this cancer treatment another unforeseen cost; probably about $3-4k worth of dental work to be done; couple root canals, couple extractions and a re-construction of a tooth and post via plate.. “hooray” (please note the sarcasm dripping here as I type that)
PLOT TWIST - COVID 19 finally claims Aja.
So.. 3+ years of managing to avoid the dreaded ‘Vid’ Aja finally succumbed just on Sunday.. meaning a whole week of her treatment and all her scheduled dental etc has to be pushed back for 7 days..
Aja managed to avoid catching it even when I had it last year in the same household, and our house mate has also never had it, so home is full of sanitizer and surface sprays etc this week, luckily Housemate & I both can work from home so less external exposure to others this week.
It hasn’t ALL be doom and gloom; to celebrate the end of Aja’s Chemo treatments; we used flight credit from a cancelled trip last year and spent 2 night/3 days in Nelson over Anzac Day. Nelson was chosen as they had an art show of Gary Baseman’s ‘Momento Moa’ he is one of Aja’s favourite artists and the show was everything we could have hoped for, and the flights and weather were fantastic and easy too.
It was a very welcome reprieve and respite between the cycles of hospital visits & treatments.
Aja also has started Pilates thanks to a targeted class subsidised through one of the many cancer foundations and run via Back In Motion. This, along with The Wellness Centre (who she was able to secure a referral for via her oncologist) will give an awesome gateway back to physical health and recovery from all the sedentary nature that this whole journey creates.
This is one heck of a journey so far and to think we still have so much to go is daunting at times, but having emotional support and the financial help you give means the world.
Thanks for reading, and thanks again to those that give donations. It is needed, and it is humbling.
XX Phil & Aja and the fur-kids.

Radiation has been scheduled to continue w adjustments to times to avoid other patients! ♥️🙏
Just past halfway!
14 March 2023
Hey everyone!
The givealittle has closed (Have asked them to extend as we are still facing treatment and recovery times)
Aja is currently prepping for her 8th (of 12) weekly Chemotherapy sessions following the 4 bi-weekly sessions she had prior.
A lot changes in your world when Cancer shows up.. summer day trips in the sunshine get negated due to sensitivity to the UV exposure… dinners and events with friends get shelved as a low white blood cell count means you can get sick super easy.. working in the garden gets a tiny time limit as the energy involved in Physical Labour just wipes out your ability to function for a day and a half after..
And still, Aja is powering through this.. striving to remain inspired, to create, to maintain a semblance of normality and control over these circumstances that don’t surrender any control.
It’s not pretty, it’s not easy, it’s f*cking difficult.
And yet, she’s still herself.
This Cancer is going to lose this fucking fight cos it picked the wrong broad to mess with.
Aroha nui to all.
I’ll try and keep you all updated as I can.

Second Chemo Drug Starting!
27 January 2023
Weekly sessions start today.
Scheduled for 12..
All new Anti-Emetic protocol too..
here’s hoping for less fatigue, and none of the scary side effects this one can have.
In there this afternoon!
This morning though, Aja has her follow up Liver MRI to see if the spots on her liver (seen in initial scans in October/November) have changed/gone.
Hopefully some definitive news to show we’re on the right track!
Aroha nui.

Pre Session 4
13 January 2023
Today my beautiful wife has her 4th Chemo Session, the last of this round of Drugs, and then preps to start her weekly rounds on the next drug..
the love and support from the givealittle has been amazing, it’s still open so if you want to donate you still can. All the outpouring of love has been incredible & wonderful.
I cannot imagine how it is to be house bound for 6 months mostly..
Battling between fighting off the cancer, and recovering from the barrage of drugs while not being able to spend long outside or having enough energy go for a walk or do anything that brings you long periods of joy..
Aja has kept her head up and soldiered through this cabin fever inducing time.. more worried about how her being home so much affects my working from home, and how much time I have to take off for the appointments etc when she can’t drive or always remember the heavy layers of information given to her as she’s still healing her concussion & TBI from 2 years ago too,.
Just a wee post really to show appreciation to all and mostly to my beautiful wife Aja, I see you, I love you, and you are my hero x

Xmas & Round 3 of Chemotherapy
29 December 2022
First of all, just want to wish each and every one of you a Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays etc.. this time of year can be a lot for many reasons and however you spend it; celebrating or hibernating, I hope you have the perfect time for you and your needs :)
We had a nice, quiet little Xmas Day. Exchanged gifts in the morning and had a video chat w Aja’s folks, before talking to my Dad too.
We then just hung out, had a bbq and a nice leisurely evening.
Pretty Perfect low key day.
We got up on the 26th and drove to Wanaka for a day trip to visit The Wanaka Lavender Garden (todays picture) it’s a fantastic place and the day turned on the nicest weather.. a little too nice, as 33 degrees made walking round in the sun too much for us and with Wanaka having horrific staffing levels at all their restaurants etc we actually then had to try Cromwell (no luck) and then Alex (reduced to KFC) to get some lunch.. still, hard to dampen the spirits on a beautiful day.
Aja had round 3 of chemo this morning, and her chemo port under the skin was being a little problematic, so, with all the radiography staff on holiday, they had to run a standard line into her vein in the arm and slow down the fluids today, our normal hour and a half was 2+ today.
30 degrees in the backyard at home for the 2nd straight day has meant we now have the other fan upstairs to try and keep some cooler air moving around and sleeping under just the sheet is even muggy thanks to cuddly cats!
We’ve been enjoying the prepared meals that have been donated from some of you. They are absolute life savers on the higher fatigue days and have made those days manageable many times already.. so grateful.
I’m off work until next Friday so we are hoping for another day trip or two, plus aiming to get a day of weeding in the back garden too.. if anyone wants to volunteer to join, you are more than welcome to 😅🤣
Ok, too hot to make much more sense.

Post Session Two
18 December 2022
There are so many steps long this journey that continue to hammer home how real this thing is.
This week, it’s hair loss.
The unavoidable Elephant In The Room when it comes to breast cancer and chemo.
The night before Session 2, Aja had her first little “extra volume” shed..
Today, day 4 Session 2. We have trimmed her neckline and tidied up the top to allow the shedding to be less imposing.
Sometime in the next day or so, my beautiful wife will sport a Tank Girl haircut.
And then she may not sport any hair.
There’s a lot of body issue stuff that is involved w all surety, but for a woman, Breast Cancer, Mastectomies, hair loss.. it must be an absolute dismantling of so many things that have defined you as a woman to society.
I am so proud of Aja for being so amazing x
Can’t wait for her selection of wigs to arrive and for her to rock some amazing bandanas or whatever she chooses to wear!
Thanks again for the love and help and support and kindness x
Big shout out to Winter Tattoo for a heartfelt Xmas Dinner and to an amazing woman who sent a whole weeks plus of groceries this week!!
Truly in awe.

MIA
13 December 2022
Hey team,
Sorry the lack of update since session 1, session 2 is Thursday this week.
There was lots of learning and adjustment to everyday life over the past 14 days.
The weather has gotten nicer, the days longer and mornings (much) brighter..
This lead to new black out curtains for the bedroom to allow Aja better rest..
The fatigue has lead to longer mornings in bed and earlier nights too..
So Aja invested in some AMAZING Foam Pillow Supports that shape her bed experience to being comfy like the hospital beds that raise up
(But without the tech)
Will bring more news more often now that we are getting a rhythm to this.
Love you all.

24th November - Surgery follow up, chemo port install & chemo education.
26 November 2022
So we got up on this day to get Aja to Mercy for surgery 2.
This time a small hour long surgery to install the chemo port.
That went very well :D
Aja is now officially part of The Borg Collective and as such gains all the knowledge of the group… wait.. no.. this isn’t my sci-fi fan novel.
After she came back from her port insertion, we did a Chemo Education session w one of the nurses (the 3 of the cancer nurses at ‘Manaaki at Mercy’ are all fantastic and operate on a 24 hour on call service so we will get to know them all well)
We got the schedule for Aja’s chemo and the supporting drugs, all on a handy checklist chart.
Chemo starts Thursday 1st of December.
For 20 weeks..
20 weeks takes us to mid April..
That’s the chemo portion as currently forecast..
Barring no hiccups from low white cells count, no reactions to chemo, no delays due to any other reasoning..
20 weeks right now feels like a lifetime.
Then radiation therapy ..
Cancer is scary.
The treatment, long, hard, risky and expensive.
I cannot fathom where we would be without insurance, without this givealittle..
Without the meals that have been dropped off/delivered…
Without the messages of love and support…
Without each and every single one of you that reads this and is part of this with us.
It gives me strength to be extra strong for Aja, who is doing so f*cking well and is so brave, and courageous and inspiring.
Love you all!
Phil

Chemo, more surgery, Wigs, Hats and 3-6 months of 1 income
19 November 2022
Revisiting timelines and reviewing situations is something we are getting very used to.
We had Aja’s first official Oncology appointment this week, in my head it was: “gonna be about an hour and we’d find out the plan for Aja’s 2-3 months of chemo etc”
Oh I was wrong.
It was nearly 2.5 hours in the end. The Oncologist and the Oncology Nurse we met were incredible. The plan is much bigger than we had hoped.
Aja had to whip in and get more bloods done this week, get her Marena IUD removed as it produces hormones, and prepare for another session under the scalpel next week.. (this time to pop in her chemo-port.)
Thank goodness for insurance btw.
Plan now is 2 different chemo-therapies, one every 2 weeks for 12 weeks and then another for a further 8 weeks. With follow ups each week too.
There is a 24/7 helpline due to the potential side effects list.. some of which are pretty scary. Plus a 3 monthly stomach injection designed to halt the production of oestrogen & progesterone.
I’m happy to answer any and all questions that I can. There’s so much I could write but I don’t want this to feel like a novel or a chore for me or you who are reading.
We did get a pretty good time this week too: who knew wig shopping could be so fun 😅 the book you choose from via HairCare Market (shout out Suzie Cruise for your help) is full of some great wigs and then some amazing Golden Girls/Melrose Place/Dynasty options.. I’ll pop a pic up in the next update.
Anyway, it’s Saturday & I’m sitting in bed having a coffee and enjoying my morning w Aja.
Will write again soon.

Home Stuff
14 November 2022
Having Aja home has been good for my own motivation to do extra little tasks that have been “going to happen”.. my latest is the pictured shelf in the kitchen.. thanks marketplace! There’s a second one of these that’s smaller and due to go above and to the right #teammlongarms
Aja’s settling into her recovery, started her physio exercises and generally waiting while she gets closer to her Oncologist meeting on Wednesday as we get ready for her surgical follow up and then start her Chemotherapy.
More updates to come this week.
Also, a massive shout out and thanks to a special someone who had their work make a donation to this for us. Unexpected and humbling x

1 Week Home. Recovery so far..
8 November 2022
So it’s been 7 days (8 now) since Aja had her surgery.💖💝
She’s home, and doing her best to take it easy.. which is a challenge in and of itself. 😅
What a week it’s been; day one of being home included putting down a beautiful bouquet of flowers to remove the non pet friendly ones (Lillies, Mums & Eucalyptus oh my) only for Leo to essentially teleport to the flowers, have a munch and immediately start foaming from the mouth.. so that involved an emergency vet trip, an overnight fluids drip and several hundred dollars in bills.. he’s on the mend, but probably 70-75% of his normal self.
Trying to replicate the functionality of the auto raising hospital beds via pillows is a nightmare 🤣 Aja’s side of the bed has literally 10+ pillows and cushions wedged in and around her to form a cocoon of moderate comfort.. always hard to achieve with a wound drain siphoning out your wound-juices. 🧃
Oh, speaking of the wound drain, that’s a whole other story; once Aja is producing less than 40ml of fluid in a 24 period she can get the drain removed..
(usually 7-10 days from surgery)
She’s close which is great, but the siphon is regulated by a gentle pressure valve on the collection bottle, we noticed on Sunday eve that Aja’s tube was full of liquid and the valve had popped up, so needed to be replaced (now something we know how to do here, but at the time needed a nurse to do.. Community Nurse team finishes at 9:30pm.. this happened at 9:34pm.. so off to ED at Public.. we get in at 9:45pm, and stand in queue to be triaged.. we get seen at 10:10pm, move to a bed at 10:25pm and then wait til 11:45pm for them to find a replacement drain bottle and someone to attach it.. then LUCKILY the on duty Surgeon comes to have a once over of Aja’s wound and drain to allow us to discharge at 12:35am instead of waiting till after whatever late emergency surgery she was about to go do..
home about 1am.. 🥱
Monday was full of a GP visit and arranging alternate pain relief options, Aja ordered her Lymphoedema sleeve
https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/health-a-z/l/lymphoedema/
And we even looked briefly at Prosthetics & Wigs in NZ to be slightly ahead of the next steps. 💟
We also had a care package from my work arrive.. a big box full of shower treats, face masks for Aja, self care diaries (for both of us) a beautiful candle, a wheat pack, loads of wee goodies.. that was so very thoughtful and touching. 💝
I have to take my hat off to the Health Professionals we have dealt with, from Aja’s GP, to the Surgeon and his staff, all the incredible Nurses at Mercy & Marinoto, the ED help, the community based nurses.. the care, the understanding, the heart they bring to this process makes it easier.
There are days, when the pain is high, or the reality of the surgical process and diagnosis etc weighs f**king heavy.. but having the people fighting with you and helping you be so on point is uplifting.
The road ahead is long, we’ve just cleared the first hurdle.. everyone reading this has been a huge part of this with us. 🫶
Your support and time and love give us strength.
Aroha nui.

T Minus 2 days - [T stands for Tit]
29 October 2022
Hey Everyone,
Since the last update Aja has had both lots of MRIs (Breasts & Liver) and has now had her Pre Op w the surgeon and her Pre Admission w Mercy Hospital.
The MRIs showed that currently the cancer is confined to the Left Breast and lymph nodes associated to that side.
The Liver MRI showed no definitive signs of cancer, so will now be monitored every 6 months or so in case of change.
This means that on Monday Aja gets a Full Single Left Breast Mastectomy, then has 4-6 weeks of surgical recovery before 3-4 months of chemo, followed by 3-6 months of Radiation Therapy and then a lifetime of hormone therapy.
In about 9-12 months from now the surgeon will remove the Right Breast for preventative measures and do a full reconstruction of both breasts.
Project Tig Ol Bitty renewal will take Aja to a comfortable healthy size C - as Aja said “Brand new room for tattoos” once she has healed. - I am in awe of her spirit.
We’re both so incredibly touched and humbled to be on the receiving end of so much love and care from everyone, every single donation and message, and hug and thought and prayer is felt, seen, needed and appreciated.
Okay, I'm going to go drink coffee #7 for the day and I’ll update you on Monday once our girl is awake.
Aroha nui,
Phil
[Pic is Omar keeping Aja safe / taking the high ground.]

Waiting.. sucks
19 October 2022
I am so glad that we have been fortunate enough to go through Private Healthcare for this process..
Comprehensive insurance has been a godsend.
And even then, with as fast as all the appointments and diagnoses etc have been, the waits are an eternity.. sitting in a torturous existence of knowing that your wife has cancer, but you just aren’t sure how bad, or how far along, or if it’s really spread to other places at all yet… it’s worse than waiting for a pee break on a country drive.
In just 3 weeks, Aja has been seen by her GP, referred to the Breast Clinic, had multiple Ultrasounds, Biopsies of her Breast tissue and Lymphnodes, multiple Mammograms, CT Scans, Nuclear Bone Tests, Surgeon Visits and still has her Breast MRI’s this week and one on her Liver next week.. all before her scheduled surgery on the 31st..
And we likely won’t know until AFTER the last MRI if Aja gets a Full Double Mastectomy that day, or if they are doing a single and the 2nd breast later on..
Oh, and we still don’t know if Critical Illness cover will pay out yet.. so it’s still currently just this givealittle and my work in terms of income.
People say things like call WINZ etc, but when you are dealing with everything else, how do you find the time, strength and mental dexterity to do these things too?
Anyway, it’s Breast Cancer Awareness month.. which is fantastic; do some reading, get your own breasts checked, have the conversation with your friends and family too. Stay ahead of your health.. and fella’s, check ya balls.
Love to you all, and thank you to everyone who has helped out and been present already. We are both so thankful.
- Phil

Thanks for the updates. You’re quite right. Waiting is hard. It’s so much easier to deal with once you know exactly what’s happening and can stop doing what we do and thinking through all the scenarios. Sending hugs to you both. L
Bone Scan result pending..
15 October 2022
Morning everyone, I’m sitting in bed while Aja has a little sleep in beside me.
Thursday came and went and Aja had her Nuclear Bone Scan; yup.. Nuclear.. they inject some low level radioactive material into a vein, let it absorb into your bones for about an hour or two, then you just lay down while they take a 45 min scan that will show any “Out of the ordinary” aspects to your skeleton.
We had preliminary results yesterday evening, and nothing leapt out of the scan as terrifying, but our surgeon is just cross referencing two areas the CT Scan highlighted on Wednesday.
Currently nothing has changed from our surgical consult on Weds.
MRI booked for next Friday, surgery for Monday 31st October.
It’s all moving so fast, which is great but also very intimidating.
Aja, as usual, is being very brave and silver-lining this.. I’m in awe of her.
Much love to everyone who has donated and shared this little fundraiser.
We have no idea how long this will take for Aja to get back to work so the love and the stress reduction we get from these donations is just the absolute world to us.

So today, Aja had both her CT scan & met w her surgeon, big day of activity and tiring.
Cancer is officially graded as a “Grade 2” which is normal for lobular type.
Surgery Mon 31st. Full mastectomy of left breast.
Right breast will be gone when recovered and new titties reconstructed then.
Surgery at Marinoto and then about 6 weeks recovery and 3-6 mths of chemotherapy, some radiation and definitely hormone treatments to turn off any remaining cells.
Bone scan still tomorrow and if there’s anything weird or unexpected there then plans may change but right now that’s the plan of attack.

My name is Katie and I have advanced MS (Multiple Sclerosis) which means I’m near immobile. My mind is willing, but my body won’t co-operate.
I was diagnosed with MS (Multiple Sclerosis) in 2002, and was told my future was going to become progressively more challenging.
MS is a degenerative disease and a thief, slowly stealing your energy, mobility and life.
When I met my now husband, Goldie, I had to tell him what he was in for. His response of “We will deal with whatever when the time comes” was a truly heart-melting moment. And true to his word; every day he’s makes selfless adjustments to cater for my reducing capacity. At just 45, I am literally stuck in ‘LOCKDOWN’ and parenting by proxy.
Goldie is and has been the sole breadwinner for our family for the past 12 years. It has been a really difficult time watching our family struggle. I’m desperate to be mobile and dream of joining the family on trips making family memories again.
There is a solution, but it’s well out of our reach financially.
The OMEO wheelchair - www.omeotechnology.com
It’s designed for use on all terrain, with Active Seat Control this helps me to use my core to control movement. Having mobility would allow my dreams come true. When I had a trial at home Goldie said I hadn’t smiled like that for years. My life could change so dramatically.

Keeping you in the loop!

I'm sorry but I have been not present here for a while, I thought you might want to know what's happening. About 6 weeks ago I had a big fall onto concrete at home and hurt my shoulder quite badly last month. It's getting better with treatments I'm receiving from Kingsland Osteopaths, they're the best.
I'm have also been applying to the Lottery grants board for funding to help with the rest that I need. I have applied for the grant - 'Individuals with Disabilities', this will fund equipment to support individuals to contribute, participate in and connect with their communities.
I want to immensely thank a few people that I has asked to write a letter of support, they were all beautifully written, THANK YOU!!!
I will keep you all posted with the outcome.
Love you all, Katie

Peter asks
Hi Katie, I design and manufacture the ViMo wheelchair (www.vimowheelchair.co.nz). You can't strictly compare the Omeo to the ViMo as they are designed for different customers and both have their place. I have a number customers with MS. The main advantages of a powered ViMo is that they are light (35kg all up), can be quickly broken down for transport (the heaviest component being the chassis at 11kg) and can be stored in small spaces (such as the boot of my Suzuki Swift). Therefore you don't need a special vehicle or a lift and the basic price is $8500 incl GST. They are very capable off-road and will climb a 1 in 4 slope. One of my customers with MS regularly travels to the 'States with hers. There are 3 different models available.
If you'd like to trial one for a week or two email of ring me (021) 43 63 53. Thanks, Peter Thompson

Her kind nature and generosity to others over the years is a testament to the type of person she is. This is now our opportunity to help Jen out during a time of challenging health. Her story is below.
Jen was diagnosed with Grade 3, Stage 3 endometrial cancer in February 2022, with the rest of the year given over to treatment - surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
Despite recovering well, unfortunately, in January 2024 she found out her journey with cancer isn’t over. This was confirmed by a PET scan in March 2024. In April, Jen had major surgery to remove a cancerous lymph node in her abdomen.
Post surgery, Jen’s medical team is recommending another course of chemotherapy and 2 years of immunotherapy. Unfortunately, the drug she needs - Keytruda - is not fully funded. This means she needs to pay $75,000 towards the cost of treatment. A small portion of this cost will be covered by health insurance, but the majority needs to be funded by Jen.
Jen’s treatment is scheduled to start mid-July 2024.
We need your support to help Jen cover these costs. Every donation counts, no matter how big or small, and would be gratefully received. Donations will go straight to the cost of the Keytruda medication.
While tomorrow is never promised for any of us, this next course of treatment is the best chance Jen has for more tomorrows with us. Please donate today. Thank you.

Posted by: Jay Jay Bloor
On the 11th June, Skylah started to develop severe headaches, and had some swelling around the area that the surgeons entered her skull for the biopsy. After another MRI on the 12th June it showed the fluid was building up so they decided to do a ‘tap’ which is just putting a needle in and draining the fluid with syringes. The fluid built up again rather quickly and on the 13th June Skylah was taken into theatre again to have a shunt put in, allowing the excess fluid to drain into her abdominal area. After that she returned to her normal happy self and we were able to return to Whanganui on the 20th June. We are still waiting for results from the biopsy to determine the best course of treatment, but it will likely be a form of chemotherapy.

Skylah had her first surgery yesterday (05/06/24) which was to do a biopsy of the tumor and drain some fluid to relieve pressure. Surgery went very well, she is very tired and we should know more when the results come back. It can take up to 2 weeks to get the results of the biopsy. For now we will not be posting post op photos but this is a very happy girl in pre-op before her surgery yesterday

Perry (52 y/o) recently had severe chickenpox that unexpectedly led to a diagnosis of advanced Pulmonary Fibrosis - scarring on the lungs. Allopathic medicine considers it irreversible and terminal, typically within just a few years.
Perry breathing is reduced by 70%, making tasks like walking, carrying things, and even talking challenging. He's now made the heart-wrenching decision to close the counselling practice that he'd dedicated himself to building over the past few years, thus losing the income which has supported their mortgage & fixed expenses.
Perry & Dawn, both independant therapists, have been in service to their community helping families and individuals heal and connect more deeply to themselves and those around them for the past 20 years.
Dawn's business cannot compensate with Perry's sudden loss of income. WINZ support is very limited. This financial strain adds to the burden of funding Perry's anti-fibrotic treatments (crucial in slowing down/reducing scarring) Pharmaceutical versions are not publically funded in NZ, making them way out of reach, so Perry is pursuing promising alternative treatments, but the costs strain the family further.
They now seek your support to ease their unexpected crisis. Your generosity will make a meaningful difference on this new journey, alleviating immense stress.

On day 7 he came home in an ambulance as he can barely stand or walk.
We are a couple of days into the transition from hospital to home, it's challenging in many ways. His needs are much higher than before. He is in bed, quietly healing -- and I am here with him.
He is on oxygen 24/7 now. We are trying to find a new groove, which will take some time. I cannot leave the house without cover -- which i need to implement asap! (Margi -- Perry's mum and my wonderful relief supporter, got Covid so she's out of action for a little still - what a blessing Perry didnt catch it - they were close that same day!)
My hats are changing rapidly. Meals and tending to him are primary. We have nurses who come weekly now to change dressings (a few pressure sores from no movement for so long) We will try one of the carer agencies (random people at kinda random times -- not so keen, but we hope it may help me)
We are STILL learning more about ourselves as more is stripped away. We are still grateful for our deep connection to one another. We are so solid in the awareness that, if it is his time to transition soon, it is Divine, Right and Wonderful.
What a journey it continues to be. OMG!
Your prayers and love are always welcome!

June Update Part 1
11 June 2024
Posted by: Dawn Grace Kelly
Ringing an ambulance for the first time ever is a thing. A stressy kinda thing.
Perry recently went to hospital in an ambulance. He'd been sitting up all night in pain, unable to recline. He had a large collapsed lung, reducing his lung capacity by 1/3. He was admitted to hospital. His 2nd night was the same, no sleep as he sat folded over in bed due to the pain. Sharp stabbing is how the medical team and pateints describe this. Pain relief was amped up and on day 3 he was finally able to lie back and sleep. Day 4 his pain went to a 10 level, there was a panic if it was his heart -- after a number of ECGs and xrays we knew his heart was ok. It was harrowing for Perry, and harrowing to witness so much suffering.

May Update Part 2
11 June 2024
Posted by: Dawn Grace Kelly
This intense healing journey is profound in so many ways. We are discovering how strong we are, and how rock solid our faith is.
This last month or so his days are spent sitting up on the couch with Tiger, and all his necessities. He's watching shows, listening to podcasts, music and meditations, a little drawing maybe, and lots of reading about life on the other side, NDE experiences, death and the nature of God.
He is still eating when he is feeling it. In fact he has been asking for his fave foods lately.
Special thanks to all my dear friends who have brought food -- at the end of a long day of running stuff to him, cooking at unusual times and doing all the things and admin of it all i am tired -- food is very much appreciated! (GF/DF, no chilli or dried coconut if you feel so inspired!)
Hypervigilance is a thing for Perry and I currently, as there's been a number of shocks. We are all doing pretty good considering though.
Going forward is unknown. He may get some more energy post infection, or he may be on a natural shift to transition from his body. Healing is happening regardless. We are all learning so much about ourselves during this extended ceremony of Perry's.
We LOVE LOVE LOVE your prayers and love coming in. THANK YOU!
We feel you, as, after all - we are all God of course -- it is happening to all of us. Just like death is -- we all will die in right timing.

May 29 Update Part 1
11 June 2024
Posted by: Dawn Grace Kelly
It's been awhile since I updated you on Perry's health as it's been unclear exactly what's happening. His condition is rare, with some unusual secondary issues, so trial and error is often in play.
He hasn't been so well this year. He has had to move to a hospice bed at home to help with severe reflux. We have a wheel chair for when he is well enough to walk a little to the car. His breathlessness is extreme - he cannot carry anything, stand (he can walk to the bathroom when he feels well enough only) or talk for very long. Sometimes even listening is hard as he is needing full concentration to regulate his breath. He does use a little supplemental oxygen sometimes. We have a walking frame for home to push him on sometimes.
He has lost a lot of his muscle and lots of weight.
We recently discovered he had a new infection from an unusual bacteria, looks like he had pneumonia -- on top of a severe breathing issue! Strong antibiotics were necessary, yet they were tough for him too. We're waiting to see how he lands now this has passed.
He is still able to get in an out of the bath, but it is exhausting, so oxygen must be in place for that mission - it helps a little only.
Perry is doing hard work focussing, sometimes for hours, on clearing mucous that blocks his airways. There have been some harrowing middle of the night alarm calls where i have held space while he has been terrified for his life.

Thank you , all of you, for your prayers, offerings, donations and words to support us.
Our collective connection as sparks of the God force is beautiful -- the way we love one another, despite not even knowing one another in many cases, is profound. Thank you for your love. It has enabled Perry to continue, to date, with his non-funded treatments, that are vital.
Please share our Give a Little page -- we hope for Perry to continue his treatments past the mid year mark (we we are currently at) that are bringing him stability, while i work on keeping the mortgage and all the things rolling solo-style.
We love you all!

Happy New Year!
1 January 2024
Posted by: Dawn Grace Kelly
🥳Happy New Year friends! ✨
2024 is so welcome after the most challenging year of our lives in 2023.
Our partnership is so very different to how it was when Perry still had full breathing capacity. There has been much to grieve. And we are grateful for small wins.
He is very limited to what he can do, particularly these last 6 weeks with a secondary issue bringing daily 'attacks', where, terrifyingly, he feels like he is choking, and it takes great focus for him to move through this. We now have new treatments on board for this. Moving from sitting to lying uses a lot of breath, as does a walk down the hallway.
We work towards peace, calm and presence. May 2024 bring us all more of that!
I am aware that these challenges are bringing karmic balance, as well as incredibly powerful growth opportunities for us all. There are triggers to old issues to heal, patience and grace to foster & resourcing self to get better at. I am learning to do jobs that perry used to do. And we're both grieving many things that we don't have now. (like going for a walk)
..........as I run out of space here, i will wrap this update up in a 2nd update :)

How's Perry?
15 November 2023
Posted by: Dawn Grace Kelly
Perry is adjusting well to not working for the first time in many years. It was challenging at first though! His health is stable. There are many good days, and a few not so good days, plus the odd whiz up to ER to make sure all is well, which it is. For the most part he has energy to do light work on our property, he has even mown the lawn! That's a big deal, as he wasnt able to do that earlier on this year. His last pulmonary function test showed some improvement, which is encouraging. It's a tricky jounrey to know exactly what is happening inside his lungs though. His breathing is still heavily compromised, yet he is generally managing this well. He's nebulising glutathione, (which helps clear mucous and mops up free radicals from the oxidative stress his condition entails) This helps reduce further scarring. It opens up his airways and makes breathing easier. Perry was DEEPLY touched when donations started coming in. He could literally feel the energy of the love and support touching him - that level of care was powerful for him to experience -- so wonderfully healing in itself! Thank you so much for sending your love, support and generosity. At this stage we're able to stay in our family home, and fund Perry's treatments, which makes life easier for Perry to concentrate on his healing journey. Bless you all! love Dawn

Nash is a reliable person who has always supported her family through difficult times, including her mother's cancer diagnosis and her father's dialysis treatments. She worked in Singapore to support them and was only able to save for herself after their passing. This allowed her to pursue further education and a new life in New Zealand.
Sadly, she was diagnosed with cancer after only a year in NZ. She has since suffered weight loss and struggled with pain, along with the anxiety of limited funds as an international student.
She has urgently started radiation therapy, the first of an expensive multiple-phased treatment, which includes chemo and surgery—all with the hope of beating this disease.
Despite having limited resources and networks in NZ, Nash battles her cancer with courage, but the financial burden continues to mount. Her student visa insurance can only cover a small cost of the total, and she will not be able to continue her treatment if she can't make payments on her next therapy.
We are asking for your support to help Nash during this difficult time. Our goal is to ease financial stress and allow her to focus on her health and well-being. Your prayers and words of encouragement are also greatly appreciated as she navigates this challenging chapter of her life.

Nash has finished 10+ sessions of radiotherapy.

Update 1 - 14th of May
14 May 2024
Hi all,
We thank you all for the donations and prayers!
We thought to make a few updates with Nash’s situation:
- Nash has started Radiation therapy this week - so far she needs to get about 280ml of liquid in her bladder. It’s a bit tricky, but she’s managing. No side effects so far, and 25 more therapy sessions to go as of today, 14th May.
- Nash opted to take the therapy in NZ instead of the Philippines due to the following reasons:
> The cancer has affected her lymph nodes, and there’s now a risk of her other organs getting affected - her doctors needed her to jump on the therapy as soon as possible
> Flying back to the PH would mean having to go by public hospitals - this would mean delays. There are also caps on local grant supports (usually up to 50KPHP) which barely covers the cost.
> The next option is to go private route—and St Luke’s Hospital in the Philippines have the same price range as in NZ.
> She does not have much family left in the Philippines. Her parents have passed away, so there's minimal support for her in the PH- which means having to commute and bring herself to the doctors ALONE. And going through pain, day by day, alone.
On behalf of Nash, we’re very thankful for your support. Every help from you counts - from prayers, donations, words of support, or sharing the link to your networks as well. Every bit to make Nash feel she’s not alone in this fight.

Well it turns out that he was right and unfortunately he has been diagnosed with Stage 3 Melanoma in his Lymph Nodes.
Ossian needs to have urgent expensive treatment (immunotherapy Pembrolizumab/Keytruda) which is only partly funded.
$100,000 plus is needed.
Due to the nature of his painting job and the chemicals involved he has been advised to urgently go on leave.
Ossian is only 37 he has his whole life ahead of him.
He is a son, a brother, an uncle and a good friend to many this includes his life long companion Neo - his Labrador dog.
I am asking you all to dig deep and donate whether it be $5 or $500 it all will help.
A lot of you know Ossian as a long term Whitianga resident and I wouldn't be surprised if at some stage in your life he has selflessly helped you out because that is the kind of person that he is.
Now its our turn to help him, we know times are tough so if you cant help financially please share this page and get it out there.

Hey everyone , I’m opening the page back up as people have been messaging wanting to donate, i am absolutely jaw dropped at love and support from everyone, I don’t have words to describe how much this has helped and it warms my heart to know how many people care , the generosity has been amazing ,we have managed to secure a high interest loan from the bank and the money raised will be used to pay this back , I wouldn’t have a chance of paying this back without this , I am now on my second treatment, we haven’t seen any significant shrinkage but I’m keeping my head high and staying positive, hopefully by the next treatment we will see some shrinkage so they can chop the horrible thing of my neck , I’m keeping fit and healthy and doing everything I can to beat this , thanks so much for everyone’s love and support it helps keep my attitude positive and my mind and body strong , I’ll keep everyone updated on how things are going . I’ll beat this thing and come out the the other side stronger than ever , thanks again love yas all ❤️💪😊

Help Ed rebuild his life & spirit,Please help Ed rebuild his life & spirit after a horrific accident that has sadly led to one of his legs being amputated.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/fefae2f0-6323-4a8e-be96-b172008d51ff-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/help-ed-rebuild-his-life-and-spirit,12666.0,0.0,316 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/help-ed-rebuild-his-life-and-spirit,16 May 2024,16 May 2025,0,Auckland,120,"At just 23yrs old, Ed's life has taken an unexpected turn. A horrific accident on May 12 (Mothers Day) left him in a critical condition, requiring urgent airlifting from his home in Taranaki to Auckland. The aftermath is heartbreaking; Ed had to undergo the amputation of one of his legs.
Known for his unparalleled kindness and generosity, Ed was on his way home from his job as a caregiver when tragedy struck. He became an innocent victim of someone else's negligence at a T junction.
Remarkably, even in the face of such adversity, Ed's thoughts were not solely about himself. On awakening from his coma, his first concerns were not about his own well-being, but about his ability to continue his passion for caregiving and fostering cats. That's the kind of person Ed is—selfless, compassionate, and unwaveringly hopeful.
Now, Ed faces a long and challenging journey ahead as he learns to navigate life with a disability. But he's not alone. This givealittle page is a beacon of hope, a collective effort to support Ed as he rebuilds his life. Your contributions will not only provide financial assistance but also offer Ed the comfort of knowing that he has a community rallying behind him.
Every donation, no matter how big or small, will make a meaningful difference in Ed's recovery and will assist him in regaining independence.
Thank you for your generosity and for joining us in supporting Ed as he embarks on this journey towards healing and hope.

Life seemed completely normal until Yvonne noticed a lump on her 12 year old daughter Chantelle's neck. As a trained nurse she was quick to arrange to see a doctor and to get it assessed.
Unfortunately, on the 8th of March their worst fears were confirmed when the result came back positive for cancer in Chantelle's parotid gland. After this discovery the very next day they were in Christchurch for an MRI and in mere days further assessments and treatments have begun.
Chantelle now faces multiple rounds of chemo along with surgery to battle this cancer, which mean the family need to uplift their life from the West Coast and live dual lives to receive treatment in Christchurch.
As Yvonne has just returned to work this means she doesn't have a lot of leave and isn't able to work as she needs to be in Christchurch with Chantelle to support her daughter through this tough treatment time, which means months ahead are going to be challenging.
Funds will go to support Yvonne and her family to allow focusing on Chantelle, to be with her as much as they can, and support the entire family to be with one another in this unprecedented challenge for them.

My last scan showed nothing of concern, I understand that doesn't mean you are all clear and can go back to a normal life, it means we will see you again in 6 months and look again. I believe that will be my life for the next 3 to 5 years, but also believe the scans will become less frequent if they continue to look good. I am realistic enough to accept that ""one day"" its not going to be ""nothing to worry about"" but until then I want to live.
My 50th birthday is coming up soon so that's something to look forward to.

Going for a scan & having a needle in my arm has become a normal event for me now, I still remember my first time, it was all so scarey & the machines were frightening, but now it's just get it done & I'll see you in 6 months for the next one. Wow how I have changed in 3 years.

After returning home from the model aircraft national championships I was asked to have a heart check at my doctor's this morning, they were very pleased with my results & I'm sitting at a 4% probability of a cardiac event in the next 5 years, that's sitting in the middle of the green band, so that's reassuring. They will retest every 5 years because of my age & recent history.

Oh Adam it is a pain. I have an inkling of how you must feel as I have a precancerous lesion just inside the corner of my mouth which Nick is going to cut out in Jan. He was thinking of a topical cream but there's no data about its use inside the mouth. When you really want to fundraise big time for Keytruda, I will share this far and wide.

I have just had a call from Radiology, my pet scan is due on Friday, this is an interesting event, 24 hours prior you go on a no sugar no carbs diet, then they inject you with a radioactive dye that is sugar based, cancers love sugar and eat it up making them glow on the scan. Hopefully the inoperable tumor in my lung has not grown or changed & I have a bit more time before I need the immunotherapy. Until then I'm going to keep living like I don't know what the future holds.

Today I gave my consent to start the immunotherapy process, it's all starting to get real scary now, I'm committing to a 2 year treatment plan and the cost of approx $79,000 for the full treatment with only $6000 raised so far its a real leap of faith that it will all work out in time. So many questions for the oncologist when I see him. Really nervous about starting this next phase but after the last 2 years I'm confident it's the best thing to do right now. Wish me luck & please help me pay for this life saving medication.

Really hoping the funding comes in and the medication is troublefree.
How did you come up with that amount?
5 April 2023
To be honest it was a quick estimate of the cost of a 2 year course of keytruda, it breaks down to $8000+gst per treatment but cost capped at $60,000+gst by pharmac with a $400 per dose fee for the infusion that runs for approximately half an hour but must be done under close supervision. The standard treatment is administered every 3 weeks but there is an option to do every 6 weeks. I have so many questions to ask my specialist when I see him for the next consult.

Our little Harper was born prematurely and soon after we were told both of her kidneys were rapidly failing. Our whole world changed overnight and many nights were spent beside her hospital bed hoping and praying that she would pull through. Through operations, infusions, dialysis and even going completely deaf for 18months she has fought just as hard as we have for her to be here with us and we will win this last major battle with her too so that she can step into a life of living opportunity rather than one of just surviving.
This transplant will be a new life for us all. Harper won't have to spend 12+hours EVERY night hooked to a machine, nor spend hours a day hooked up to a feeding pump, no tubes in her little body 24/7, she won't be stuck in survival mode anymore and she will have energy to run around, learn and grow unlike she has ever been able to before!
We have poured our hearts and souls into giving Harper the best opportunity of life that we could, and always will. This has included the financial side of the battle which is why we have put down our pride and determination and stepped into humble humility to ask for some help because we cannot do it on our own, no matter how much we would like to.
All donations will go towards transplant related costs, requirements to return home/specialists for the next year. God Bless you all and thank you all so much for helping us!

Hi everyone,
A wee update on Harpers transplant. As of two days ago we have hit a big hurdle and Harpers transplant has been postponed to the 12th of August. She has been admitted into Starship Hospital until then to switch from peritoneal dialysis to haemodialysis which can only be done in Starship for little children. So we have settled in to Starship for an even longer haul now as she will be here until transplant can happen. We thank everyone so much for the support we have received as we couldn't do this without everyone's amazing help and support!
We will continue to update everyone as things progress and hopefully there will be no more delays so we can hopefully be home before October!! She already cannot wait to get home.

Rochelle is facing the toughest battle of her life – a courageous fight against secondary cancer and together with Michael she needs our help - with non funded monoclonal antibodies called Avelumab required every 3 weeks for 2 years at $8k per dose. She is undergoing more chemo and awaiting surgery.
Rochelle has a heart full of love for her family – daughters, grandaughters, and a step son - and of course her devoted husband Michael. She also has a wide network of incredible friends across the world including family and friends in SA and Australia.
She is strong, fiesty, tenacious, determined, funny and always has that radiant smile even when things get tough. Rochelle and Michael don't like to ask for help but are always there to help others.
Please join me in any contribution large or small to help support them through this tough time so they concentrate on each other and getting her back well again and back to the life she adores.
Warm regards and a big thanks in advance. Please share with your networks!

MRI and CT scans taken within hours of being admitted to Auckland Hospital revealed a tumor on his brain, located on the ""language centre"". 4 months later, Kiki underwent brain surgery. Unfortunately the entire tumor could not be removed and upon the pathology results has been diagnosed with malignant, Stage 4 cancer. The next step is adjuvant treatment with both chemotherapy and radiation.
He has been told that the cancer is treatable, but not curable. Kiki is exploring alternative options overseas for treatment and/or medication.
In the meantime, and in the near future it is unknown when or if Kiki may be able to return to work and it has been an incredibly tough time for him and his family.
He and his partner Renee have 2 beautiful young girls, Teiana - 6 years and Talei - 21 months old.
Kiki is usually a fit and active person, who has dedicated his life to family, friends and helping his community. As a qualified Sports Exercise and Athletic Performance Coach, he has helped many teams and individual athletes with his services and expertise.
We hope to see him return to his line of work and would greatly appreciate and support to him and his young family as they navigate their way through this difficult journey.
Kiki and his loving family would like to extend their heartfelt appreciation for what support comes their way.♥️

Mum had her double mastectomy last week, everything went well. She was told she wouldn't get her pathology results for 2-3 weeks so we were prepared for a wait. But this week, on Thursday, she got the phone call from her oncologist. The call of a lifetime! No cancer detected.... none in breast tissue and none in lymph nodes. She is CANCER FREE! The journey isnt over, but it sure has a better outlook now. Mum still is continuing on with keytruda for now. She will be having this every 6 weeks for the rest of the year, to complete a full 12month course. She starts a bone infusion in roughly 6 months. This will be every 6 months for the next 3 years to reduce risk of return. But for now, we celebrate. We celebrate life, cancer free! I just wanted to say, a massive thank you to each and every person who contributed to helping us fund the keytruda for mum, as well as the ongoing love and support in various ways. Thank you doesn't cut it, but thank you all so very much! What a Rollercoaster the last nearly 7 months has been. But for now we are so very grateful to you all. And to the main lady, Mum, I am so proud of you! You have been to hell and back but you have come out of this stronger than ever. You never gave up, no matter how awful you felt, or how sick you were. You carried on day after day! You gave it your all! You are SO loved and we are so incredibly happy to have you in our lives for many, many more years to come! Love you always xxx

Chemo finished!
17 March 2024
Mum has finished her iv chemo! She had her last dose (after 22 grueling weeks) on Wednesday. She just needs to get through the next 10 days and then she's out the other side. Her lovely chemo team brought her a little treat to celebrate and cheered her on.
She has a double mastectomy booked for early April, and then a delightful holiday in a tropical island (which she booked pre diagnosis, and truly has worked out to be the most perfect timing really!!)
After surgery she will be discussed at the MDT meeting to confirm if she needs radiation or not. The plan is to continue keytruda every 3-6weeks for roughly a year, have a bone strengthening infusion every 6 months for 3 years, and possibility of oral chemo depending on results from the surgery. 💜🏖🍹

Weekly chemo DONE!
24 January 2024
Just a quick update to say, this superwoman has finished her weekly chemo. 12 weeks down, 8 to go. Next week Mum is starting the next chemo, this one is fortnightly for 8 weeks. She is doing so well, I cannot be prouder of her. Today the doctor at chemo asked her why she is always so cheerful, her response.... why not, because life is good! She has been given a rough diagnosis with a rocky road, but still is looking at the positives in life. What an absolute legend 😘 love you mum!!!

Run for Reido was created in 2021 four months after the tragic suicide of Reid Keady O’Leary. This run was designed to create chatter surrounding suicide awareness and mental health.
This run is very special to me. This is the fourth year that this run will be happening. Creating the run this year was fun, complicated and a bit teary eyed. I had beautiful family and friends helping and supporting me. We met every week to help make this run amazing and to honour our beautiful boy Reido.
All the donations are being donated to the Reid O’Leary Charitable Trust on behalf of the Run for Reido organisation. The purpose behind the trust is to raise the awareness of suicide education and prevention amongst Youth and Young Adults in New Zealand.

He'd had an Aortic aneurysm causing an aortic dissection (https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/your-heart/heart-conditions/aortic-dissection) the seriousness meant he, accompanied by wife Sharon were immediately transferred to Wellington Hospital to undergo emergency surgery. Chris’s family were informed of his status, risks and chances so all rushed to Wellington to be with him.
Scoop survived the air ambulance transfer and underwent a 10.5 hour surgery. He was put into a coma to allow his body time to recover and to further asses his status. During this time, family stayed by his side receiving a mixture of news, some things that gave them hope but also other associated challenges with questions around his other organs and possible affects to his movement and cognitive ability.
On Saturday 18th he was a little more stable and an attempt to wake Chris up was rewarded with some basic acknowledgment to their communication.
Scoops status changes hourly and he is making progress through small steps, it is likely though that he will face more invasive operations once he is more stable and has a long road ahead.
More will be known in coming days, but Chris will likely be confined to hospital for some time which will be tough for the Halas tribe to manage their day to day lives, own families and work commitments.

MS is a long lasting (Chronic) disease of the central nervous system. It is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, a condition in which the body attacks itself by mistake.
MS is an unpredictable disease that affects people differently.
Lance is very driven and like he does with everything he is tackling this head on.
Life has changed a lot for a guy who loves a beer and catch up with his friends, but who is also very active in sports and outdoors. Lance has given up drinking, on a strict diet and been doing as much gym and fitness as possible to build up strength and slow the symptoms of this disease.
He has been very proactive in learning about MS and its possible treatments and is now in the process of organising Stem Cell Treatment in Mexico which hopefully will cease any further deterioration in his health and give him the opportunity to live a full life for longer.
As you can imagine, this does not come cheaply, costing approx. NZD$100k just for the treatment, plus flights, time off work & post meds.
Lance & his family have been very private about what they are facing, and the costs involved, this is a huge undertaking for them to tackle alone.
We are planning on Fundraising locally with other events and means, but this won’t be enough to cover this huge amount, so we have set this page up for anyone that can and would like to donate to support Lance and help get him to Mexico for this life changing treatment.

Father diagnosed with melanoma cancer in October. He underwent initial surgery to remove the tumour & additionally all four lymph nodes on left side as cancer had spread to this region. He has been undergoing immunotherapy treatment & has completed 7 cycles so far. Suffering from all associated side effects including thyroid issues, muscle fatigue, Brain fog, headaches, he is now unable to work many days.
Last month the family received a bill from the hospital concerned to inform them the insurance was exhausted and that self-payment is now required for all treatments moving forward.
He missed an important cycle of treatment while the family intensively investigated all options to help them out. All options have led to a dead end at present, but the family have not given up hope.
They paid out $10,000 nzd for him to have his last treatment. Using all available savings and requiring partial use of a credit card to fund this.
The next treatment is in 20 days from where another $10,000 will need to be paid. Stress and anxiety levels are running high.
Please help this wonderful family who find themselves in a terrible position where money comes before life. They are trying to return to NZ however there is a 3 month waitlist and they will need money to pay for treatments in the mean-time.
Anything would help and be much appreciated.
Be thankful for today, because in one moment your entire life can change.

This is organised by friends, not family.
Our beloved friends, Fi & Carl, and their gorgeous baby boy George are on the toughest journey and they need all the support we can give.
On April 2nd, George was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a cancer originating in nerve tissue. A diagnosis that shook Fi & Carl’s world to its core. This news has shattered the blissful bubble surrounding George, the stark reality of George’s diagnosis has left them grappling with emotions and fear beyond words.
Since the move to Starship it has been a whirlwind of tests, treatment plans, and unfortunately a lot of knock backs. The cancer has spread to his kidney, liver, adrenal glands and bones. The latest biopsy results confirmed George’s high-risk status, meaning a longer and more intense treatment plan ahead. He’s now an inpatient, requiring round-the-clock care.
To find Fi & Carl facing such hardship once more seems completely inconceivable. Their strength and resilience is truly inspiring. We know them for their warmth and generosity, let's show them our love and compassion as they fight for their precious boy.
For those who wish to extend a helping hand to the family during this challenging time, your contributions will help ease the financial burden, and show them that they are definitely not alone in this fight.
George: You’ve got this, little warrior!
Fi, Carl & Moo: We’ve got your back.

George today has started his 4th round of chemotherapy. This far he has handled each round like an absolute trooper. Most of the time, we find it hard to believe he is even sick, he’s so happy, hungry and active. With that comes the anxiety of waiting for the ball to drop, when things might not be going so well. We will cross that hurdle when it comes, until then, we relish in our beautiful 6month old boy.
The past 10 weeks have been the hardest weeks of our lives. Navigating the emotional rollercoaster you so desperately want to get off. Never did we expect to have to process such intense emotions, a hell you wouldn’t wish upon your worst enemy.
We will keep updating on here as we can, and when we have the mental capacity I promise we will go through and individually thank you all. We again, are so extremely grateful to all of you, for your words and generosity.
Please continue to keep George in all your thoughts and prayers.
Love, Fi, Carl, Maggie and George

Hello everyone,
It’s bittersweet writing this as we never thought we would be on the receiving end of a ‘give a little’ but we are also so incredibly humbled by everyone’s generosity. We feel undeserving, but in spite of that, having to close our business for the next year or two, your kindness and generosity has definitely alleviated some of the pressure. From the bottom of hearts, thank you so much.
We are now approaching our 10th week of an unimaginable journey. George was diagnosed with High Risk Neuroblastoma. A aggressive form of cancer that requires 18months of intense treatment. We have learnt to not look too far ahead, it’s too daunting and too scary. So we live day to day and focus on the now.

Within hours Courtney and bodhi were flown to star ship via the air ambulance
Mac stayed behind to organise care for their four other children aged 1-11.

✨UPDATE FROM COURTNEY ✨
Absolute shit show again today . 😥
Mac arrived, and they said bodhi isn't set for surgery today . That he needed to do repeat bloods and surgery would be tomorrow! Mac wasn't impressed, to say the least . Honestly, the communication is terrible!
But a Dr who was pretty cool is also from Taranaki , said he will get him on surgery list for last surgery of the day . And won't bother will repeat bloods .
Then he had his surgery. Mac was still waiting on a phone call over 40 minutes later to say he was out and he could come , no call so he went in to go ask what was going on , turns out they didn't bother calling because they seen bodhis phone and thought that was macs 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ poor bodhi was so upset and really frustrated with dad because he wasn't there .
They've ordered his chemo today, so now he has to go to it tomorrow morning before his flight .
That place really annoys me , it's always something, and the communication is always sh*t.
In saying that , bodhi has one more appointment in 2 weeks, then he is set for monthly checks , home oral chemo & 3 monthly starship visits ! How amazing is that !

195 days ago, this picture was taken , This was the day after we flew up to the starship. He was diagnosed 196 days ago, 30-10-2023, at approximately 12.30pm. Man, that's a long time , and it sure feels surreal , like a lifetime , but also just like yesterday! He's come so far ! Those were some very dark times , mentally, for everyone. I Remember flying up and I was f*cking petrified for countless reasons , mostly I was alone , I was in shock , I was devastated , I'd just left my girls at home crying not knowing what was happening next , although I do remember the flight up there and I f*cking hated every moment, those little planes suck and are scary , mac wasn't able to fly up until the next day, Debbie was waiting for me at starship when we arrived that afternoon & stayed with me until almost midnight. I think by the time Mac got there , I'd already seen countless Dr's, nurses , mental health teams , coordinators , Specialists , and surgical teams . It was a lot. I genuinely felt like my brain was going to explode!
It's f*cking sad looking back , it actually hurts alot . A lot of emotions, but also sooo proud of how far bodhi has came and us as a family! Life will never be the same tbh . I know I've sure as hell have grieved life pre cancer . In saying that 196 days down 💪🏼 bodhi is so strong and resistant , he's a real champ. I couldn't be more proud of him as the awesome dude he is .

Bodhi isn't able to go up to starship this week for part 2 of this phase as his blood counts are too low still .
So will do more bloods on Friday, and try go for Monday app in starship.
On another note - his hair loss has been pretty full on this time round.
Lots of smooth patches

Bodhi had chemo today.
Went well .
Although he had meltdowns accessing port and de accessing.
His hair is falling out again , they did warn us when he changed phases it would likely happen.
He’s got the worst nappy rash imaginable - his skin looks actually burnt.
They gave his some special cream they make up the hospital to treat it.

Sharing Courtney’s status share from this yesterday 🫶🏻
For bodhis new phase starting 04/03/24 this phase is a total of 8 weeks giving there are no set backs .
We do ask ALL to please ask before you come over .( I dint care who you are , just ask) We will be back on a very strict isolation again as he will become neuropathic. This phase will be hard enough & we'd like to prevent any outside potential bugs/illness as we can.
If you have been in contact or even think you may have . Please just don't risk it.
Delayed intensification is known for a rough ride usually with a hospital stay or two . So we'd like to do our very best from the get go.
He's currently back on oral steroids , weekly chemotherapy 2x vincristine & doxorubicin . & the pegaspargase on Thursday 2 hour chemo ( HATE this one) he's previously had this & spiked fevers from it . I'm praying this doesn't happen again as he'll be back in hospital for a stay.
He will more than likely loose all his hair during this phase unless he has sometime of super powers 🧘🏼

The plane trip went well last night. had delays prior & landing got delayed they didn't get into ronald macDonald house until around 8.30-9 pm
Fasting from 6.30 am onwards.
Appointment at 11.30 . Bodhis routine obs went well ! Super fast . Bodhi had to do more bloods . That went OK.
Found out bodhi needed a heart echo to start his new phase . Wasn't booked in to Mac, and bodhi got sent back up to clinic . They then were trying to sort him into the echo . Finally, that was done !! Hours later. Communication between departments is terrible - makes for a stressful day.
Dr. The appointment went well.
Then port access and chemo started . Once that finished he went down to surgery, had to wait around for 45 minutes down there to go in , surgery went well .
Back up to clinic for monitoring, obs were good and bodhi was happy camper with dad .
Had two lunch packs !
He was starving !
Was super nice with the nurse
yay !
And they've finally got back to the Ronald mac room at 6.15pm .
Long day !
Bodhi will be super tired .
They should arrive back in the Naki midday tomorrow
Moving into this phase - he will have chemo every Monday - and will be having a two hour treatment of the pegaspargase chemo this Wednesday at Taranaki base hospital.
He has had this one twice before during his induction phase of treatment. This one’s really rough on his system and he struggled with temps etc last time. So pretty worried.
Big week for such a little guy.

Bodhi enjoying his weetbix this morning 🥹
Bodhi’s been pretty good overall.
His Eating been OK , lives on chicken flavored chips at the moment. !
He goes through stages where he will just eat one thing - it’s been shapes -crackers - sausages - precooked cold , strawberry’s
Courtney has noticed his skin is very weak , he's got a sore on his knee that just doesn't heal and every time he bangs it slightly bleeds again .
Sunblock doesn’t seem to protect him against the sun
He kicked his toe on the ground and cracked the nail and took skin off . It bleeds all the time with a slight bang to it .
He's overall pretty happy, though!
Rests a lot but plays hard too when he’s up for it.
He has his first chemo treatment in Taranaki next week - and has a at home visit for bloods next week before hand.
These are both firsts in our journey- gotta take the small wins and silver linings 🫶🏻

Happy new year 2024
5 January 2024
Hey everybody it’s been awhile since I have updated this page. - bodhi is trucking along as well as can be expected
He enjoyed Christmas and new years at home with his family. This week seen him back in star ship for a double dose of chemo -travelled via car this time instead of plane so made a few playground stops on the way there. He’s not got much of an appetite due to the chemo and no longer taking steroids so that hunger from the then is not there.
Thank you all for your ongoing love and support.
Things have been really tough for bodhi and his family as they navigate the new normal which as I’m sure you can all appreciate takes a massive toll on everyone

Today was Courtney’s birthday (Bodhis mum) Today also marked 25 days since they left Taranaki
25 days since the four girls back home saw them. Today they travelled home after bodhis chemo this morning !
They landed in Taranaki just after 3pm and made their journey home
As I’m sure you can all imagine there were lots of tears and cuddles to be had.
Bodhi will continue his journey and they will travel back to Auckland next week for more surgery and chemo. - but in the mean time will soak up all that lost time between them all.
The journey is not over - just changed to another part of there new life
Courtney Mac and the kids will need just as much love and support if not more as they learn to navigate their new normal.
Things will be very different than what they were as they try to keep bodhi as healthy as possible and avoid any illnesses etc.
for now they rest in their home for the first time in a month - all together
Happy birthday Courtney 💕

Bodhi doesn’t have a lot of energy - and sleeps lots - he has times where he’s still quite wobbly on his legs and sore. They have settled in the Ronald McDonald house ok - but looking forward to heading home back to Taranaki hopefully soon. The girls can’t wait to be reunited with there parents and bodhi.

Bodhi had his first clinic visit today, it went well.
He had another round of chemo today - he's been very grumpy this afternoon , will be from the chemo among many other things and isn’t feeling the best.
His blood results are still on the rise (doing what we want them to do) so that's a real positive .
His walking has been better today so that's been awesome for Mac & Courtney to see Bodhi not being so weak and wobbly on his feet.

Today bodhi had his chest needle removed - as Courtney and Mac prepared for their move to Ronald McDonald house.
This afternoon their discharge was completed as they carried all of their stuff from the hospital down the road a little to what will be their new home for the time being. ✨🧡
Thank goodness for the Ronald McDonald house for out of towers like them
Bodhi being a bit unsure asked to go back to his room (at the hospital ) a little after they arrived
As I’m sure you can all imagine this is a big step and moves them to the next part of the journey.
Bodhi still has really low haemoglobin and neutraphil levels.
He often is low on energy and has
Lots of big emotions for this little guy 😞
He enjoyed another Spag bol dinner tonight !
Mac and Courtney have spent the last wee while learning all the ins and outs of the many medications they will be preparing and administering throughout the day and night with bodhi.
Keep them in your thoughts as they navigate this next part
Thank you all for your continued support and kind words ✨

Thank you for your ongoing support and Kind words. We really appreciate it ✨

Today has been a bit of a rough one for both Bodhi and Mac and Courtney
. Bodhi had his chest port changed which was painful and traumatising for everyone involved. Along with a NG tube put in as bodhi is refusing meds and bottles now along with a low appetite being a recipe for disaster ( which they were using along with foods to disguise medications but he has wised up and now refusing ) after his temp spike last night it has delayed moving to the Ronald McDonald house for the time being.
He has however enjoyed snacking on his pizza flavoured shapes today. And a room shift giving a slightly different view. Has been nice all round.
Please keep him in your thoughts and surround him with living vibes as they continue to navigate this unfair journey.

Today has been another positive day today - no invasive treatments other than OBs and lots of meetings for Mac and Courtney with doctors. Having received more positive news regarding his diagnosis today. Bodhi has ups and downs with moods and energy as to be expected with all that’s going on. They are hoping to be relocated to the Ronald McDonald house soon so that’s exciting news.
Bodhi is suffering from really sore knees today - such is the territory with this type of cancer
Please keep him in your thoughts and well wishes 🧡
Today marks a week since the devastating news and flight to starship
There four girls back home are doing really well , resilient , brave sweet little girls.
*unfortunately this evening saw Bodhi take a wee turn - he has spiked a temperature - and is now being treated with antibiotics - having bloods and swabs etc done to try and spice the issue - hoping for a speedy recovery after what had been a good couple of days.

Hey everyone - bodhi had a reasonable nights rest last night - without temperatures which is a massive positive.
He woke this morning very sore and tired, little to know energy as to be expected with the first round of chemo yesterday. He’s not in good spirits today - and keeps asking mum and dad to go home, and to go in the car - mum lets him know they dont have the car with them so now asking to go in the plane. - bless him.
Suffering with a sore neck and back.
Today there is no invasive treatments so that’s a bonus other than the regular bloods and obs.
Fingers crossed this evening and tomorrow is a better for him.
Mac and Courtney wish to thank everybody for their kind words and generosity in these tough times.
Please be patient with messaging as I’m sure you can all appreciate they are both feeling very overwhelmed and tired/stressed.
This weeks been a whirlwind - and not in a good way.
Enjoy the picture of bodhis cheeky smile taken this morning.

I'm the tall one, Joe the shorter one. Joe has stage 4 lung cancer, which has proven untreatable and has spread to his liver. In short, he's toast. I love Joe with all my heart,he's been through thick and thin with me for the last 30 years. My pals and wee brother all died whilst I've been out here in NZ. I never made it to funerals due to COVID and cost, and I don't want to not try to make this sh*tty hand that's been dealt, become a lifelong regret of ""wishing I'd done something""!
Both of us are motorcycle lovers but never got to ride together due to my struggles, and availability, the idea is to try and explore NZ on Tw200s for a week or 2, dependent on Joe's health and funds etc. good old fashioned road adventure with freedom and friendship. Blow away the inevitable dark clouds.
I can't afford to get be back to Scotland in time, let alone the expired passport reality. So he suggested a bike adventure here in NZ. A last ride somewhere new. He's given away his bikes in Scotland to mates but I have a TW200 here in New Zealand and one has recently come up for sale, the timing is serendipitous, as they're hard to come by. The obstacles to this final farewell are inevitably financial. We are not rich ,or greedy, and I expect there are many more worthy causes for others to prioritize, but try I must. Haven't come up with any other ideas as of yet.The bikes are thin on the ground , and the opportunity is literally once in a lifetime,so I want to try and make that final farewell possible. Hence this.
Never done one of these fundraiser things before, so forgive my ignorance, I'm happy to provide references and transparency wherever required. my salary is stretched as far as possible. I don't drink, or do drugs, and voluntarily run recovery groups every week for 6 years, and work with children with difficulties. Joe has said he can afford to buy tickets out here, but after sorting out funeral costs, there's little to spare. The picture is of us getting to visit Arlo Guthries home. A dream come true once, thanks to the generosity and love of another great friend some 20+years ago.
Those who ride know, that ""I don't wanna pickle, just wanna ride on my motor.... sickle""! Hope someone out there can help us with this, that and the other. And I hope you never, ever have to go through this yourselves. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Bless you. Stay safe, make the most of every second, and stay shiny side up.

Joe will be in Achiltibuie, with some awesome fellow bike enthusiasts from the 5-7th of April, and then back to Edinburgh, (for a wash hopefully 🤣🤣) Then Fly out of Glasgow on the 8th for a 22hr flight to Sydney! Yup, he’s coming to see you guys in OZ!🥰 Thank you for making that possible. He arrives there on the 9th at midnight. A very brief and meaningful couple of days there and then a flight to Auckland New Zealand on the 12th. I’m so thrilled to be thinking about collecting my great friend from the airport, and truly thank every single one of you who have helped that happen. It’s a bittersweet reunion for us, but absolutely necessary. I’m going to have to stop this update at the moment, as I’ve been so focused on getting things ready, that writing this has forced me to recognise the tough part again, and it’s hard to see what I’m typing and hold back the tears. I’ll just say thank you again , and try and get a more enjoyable update up asap. I’m afraid photos have been taken on someone else’s phone at this moment, so haven’t got much to share visually. What I will share is probably sufficient to give you an insight into the last week. So much love for you all. ❤️❤️❤️

Update part 1? 😎🤷‍♂️
8 March 2024
Sorry it’s been a while since the last update, there has been an exhausting amount of jobs to do. We are absolutely blown away to have reached and passed the target goal, and are so grateful for all of your donations, supporting words, kindness and encouragement. It’s definitely happening now, which is truly amazing. It’s a roller coaster this stuff, a lot of ups and downs, today being one of utter exhaustion, so forgive me if there’s a flatness to the tone. I’m buggered! Here’s some of the big changes, and I’ll start with the big one. Joe’s oncologist has reported successful results from the last chemo treatment, in that there has been shrinkage of tumours, and scar tissue, suggesting healing. Although this isn’t a cure scenario, it has been very emotional, and he has her full support regarding the trip. Joes tenacity for this has likely played a part as well 😉 There was a great deal of trepidation prior to that appointment, so a great deal of relief to hear, but an emotional crash nonetheless. So, back to the plans. The bike has been purchased and collected, modifications are underway, and flights have been booked, and Joe has even managed to get travel insurance….for those concerned. Which as you may imagine, is quite the feat, given his existing diagnosis. Incredible ❤️Thank you. It’s a very tight schedule, and one that most would find taxing in good health, but Joe is keen to accommodate as many friends as possible. Humbled by his and your generosity. Travel dates…

A message from Joe! ❤️
29 February 2024
Hi everyone, I’m Joe.
I’d just like to say thanks a million to all you beautiful people that donated to this fundraiser to get me to New Zealand for a last blast on the bikes with my very great friend Chris.
It means a great deal to me to be able to say goodbye in person and while I’m still able to physically get to New Zealand and enjoy a final adventure that’s been a dream of mine for nearly ten years, since I last had a chance to see my friend.
I’m humbled and overwhelmed by the generosity of friends and perhaps even more so by the many strangers that have donated to this trip.
I know these strangers would become friends if and when we ever meet.
Thank you all.
Joe Mccann.❤️

Unbelievable! 🥹 We await the results of Joes appointment tomorrow, and on the back of that, flights will be booked. You’re all amazing, and we truly don’t know how to thank you enough. Absolutely amazing 🥲. We didn’t realise how much this would mean and make a difference until it became possible, leaning more towards sadness and inevitability. You’ve all given so kindly and generously, and have provided hope, smiles, excitement and joy. Thank you ☺️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Nearly Here! Nearly There!
26 February 2024
For Māori, Cape Reinga is the most spiritually significant place in New Zealand. Joe and I have placed this destination on our map.
An ancient pohutukawa tree and a lonely lighthouse mark this special place.
It is here that after death, all Māori spirits travel up the coast and over the wind-swept vista to the pohutukawa tree on the headland of Te Rerenga Wairua.
They descend into the underworld (reinga) by sliding down a root into the sea below. The spirits then travel underwater to the Three Kings Islands where they climb out onto Ohaua, the highest point of the islands and bid their last farewell before returning to the land of their ancestors, Hawaiiki-A-Nui.
We’re not quite out the tough stuff yet though. An appointment on the 29th is still to determine our movements, and a even shorter time frame has been dropped on us today, due to the bike seller having to get that deal done by Saturday. So if you were wondering if it could be more stressful, the answer is yes! This idea was born from love, and kindness, it’s come so close to fruition thanks to love and kindness, so I have the utmost faith we will ride to this beautiful and magical place with love and kindness fuelled smiles. Keep sharing folks. We need you more than ever. Thank you for getting us this far. Ps, for those who have been requesting pictures and footage. I’m doin my best to get my hands on a couple of GoPros for the trip. Will need a hand with making that into something worth watching 😉🥰✌️❤️🤞🤞🤞

Thank you John, we'll get you sorted soon mate. To Sherman at Procycle.us you understood the time restrictions and have bent over backwards and sideways to help us with what we needed. Awesome company, awesome bloke. A big shout out to the Agnew brothers who we understand plan to do a fundraiser gig over in Scotland,so keep yer eyes peeled for that. Such a beautiful, talented bunch of lads and have certainly been around since the first time I met Joe. Anyhoo,I'm supposed to keep this brief. More updates soon, and will try to include some pictures or something. This is all very new. What isn't new is a shared love for a great pal, a truly unique and larger than life individual that we all want to know is leaving loved!

A huge thank you to all who have helped so far. It’s looking more and more possible that we will get the opportunity and it wouldn’t be possible without your sharing and caring. The bike is secured by a deposit from myself, and Joe has begun to look at flights. An appointment tomorrow will determine time frames of events, so if I receive Joes consent, I’ll update. Please share with your messenger, ticky tocky,whatsups, and instagrins, as we’re a couple of old goats when it comes to interweb socialising. It really helps, and we need help really. So much love for everyone and their efforts. Thank you. C xxx ps if anyone knows charley Norman and Ewan McGregor, can you give them a nudge! They haven’t read my messages 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️✌️✌️✌️

Currently about 6000 New Zealanders have a type of dementia that began for them between the ages of 45 and 65 (and sometimes younger). This is termed Younger Onset Dementia.
Leading an active and engaged life is important for those with younger onset dementia, so they can retain good physical and mental function and remain in their own home for longer.
Typical dementia day centres are designed for older people who are less physically fit and with different social needs. Younger onset dementia men and women need activities that are physically, mentally and socially stimulating, which help them retain a sense of fun, purpose and dignity.
A day centre such as this also provides valuable respite for the spouse or other family members looking after the person living with dementia.

Alice is a loving mum to her two beautiful and energetic boys Tycho (2 years) and Wilbur (6 months). At just 30 years old, Alice received the devastating news that she has been diagnosed with Stage 4 melanoma. Alice is an incredible mum and a loving partner to Travis. Her friendly and caring personality is recognised by all her friends and family.
Alice has been fighting melanoma since 2019 when she had a mole removed from her leg. In September 2021 she found a swollen lymph node in her leg and had surgery to remove this and other lymph nodes. The biopsy found this to be Stage 3 melanoma. In February 2023 a mass in one of her kidneys was diagnosed as Stage 4 melanoma.
Several options for Alice’s treatment have been explored. Surgery was ruled out as the melanoma has grown too large and complex. Immunotherapy treatment funded by the NZ government was also ruled out at this stage as the melanoma is growing too rapidly. The oncologist has recommended targeted therapy medication (Dabrafenib and Trametinib) as the best option. This medication is currently unfunded and costs $5525 per month. A charity has now offered to cover this cost. Donations will go towards helping to look after her two gorgeous boys. If you are interested in making a larger donation please feel free to contact our family directly.
Thor Jeppesen's involvement (page creator)
We have set up this page on behalf of Alice's friends and family. I am Alice's brother.
Use of funds
Donations will primarily be used to cover the monthly costs of the unfunded targeted therapy medication (Dabrafenib and Trametinib). Any remaining funds will be used to help look after Alice's two sons.
****Update**** We are also trying one final medication option (Lenvatinib plus Pembrolizumab/Keytruda) which is also unfunded.",Donations will primarily be used to cover the monthly costs of the unfunded targeted therapy medication (Dabrafenib and Trametinib).

February update
28 February 2024
Thanks again everyone for the donations over the last few months, you have exceeded our expectations. Thanks for the support and all the food donations, it all makes a big difference.
The last few months have had a few ups and downs for Alice. Since she started her treatment she has had less pain around her kidney and has had over a month without taking painkillers. The medication also has side affects, and she has a lot of nausea.
She recently had another scan which showed mixed results. The melanoma in her lungs has shrunk, but the melanoma in her kidney has grown slightly and there are new metastasis in her liver and bladder.
Alice has been making the most of the summer, spending lots of time with her family and friends building memories. We went on a camping trip at the beach last week which was good fun.

December Update
18 December 2023
Thanks everyone for the kind donations, we have been overwhelmed by the response. Alice is starting her new treatment this week which involves a infusion every couple of weeks and pills daily. She also had a fun trip away in Taupo last weekend with her family where we had lots of laughs and made some great memories.

November Update
29 November 2023
Alice recently had a full body scan which showed that the melanoma has spread further from her kidney and is now in her liver and lungs. This means that the immunotherapy treatment she has been receiving for the last 5 months is no longer working.
Alice is now focussed on making the most of the time she has left and enjoying every possible moment with her young family. She is still able to do a lot of things at the moment but we don’t know how long this will last.
Alice would like to thank everyone for their generous contributions so far. We are asking for further donations so that Alice can have some memorable experiences with her family over the next few months. She also wants to make sure her two young boys are set up as best as they can for their future.
We are also trying one final medication option (Lenvatinib plus Pembrolizumab/Keytruda) which is unfunded and costs around $15k per month. Although it only has a small chance of prolonging Alice's life, we are still hopeful it will give her more time with her family.

New treatment
18 June 2023
Alice initially responded well to the targeted therapy, but unfortunately after a couple of months the treatment has stopped working. The treatment did work for a little while and she was able to regain some of her strength.
Alice has now started a new different treatment which is a combination of two immunotherapy drugs, one which is government funded and one which isn't. The charity (The Charity Golf Day) which covered the costs of her previous treatment has very kindly offered to also cover the costs of the new treatment. We hope that the immunotherapy works and Alice's condition improves soon.

First Treatment
12 March 2023
Alice has now had her first round of targeted therapy treatment. She has responded well and has been able to leave the hospital and go home. She is still tired and needs lots of rest, but she is enjoying her time at home with her young family.
A charity has now offered to cover the costs of the unfunded medication. We are very thankful for this and will give further updates on this when it is confirmed.

After losing her adored dad suddenly in December 2022, Ange struggled through the first part of 2023, to find out in March 2023 at age 46 that she was 24 weeks pregnant with her first child. Just when she thought her shocks for 2023 were over, Ange was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer (HER2) in late Dec 2023.
Just as Ange was planning to return to work, she now faces an even harder struggle of undergoing her treatment while still being there for her wee man, which impacts not only her return to work plans but her everyday activities. On top of her own struggles, her loving husband is a contractor and every trip to and from appointments or staying home to look after their child is a loss on income.
After Ange has her chemotherapy treatment, they should be celebrating their sons first birthday but instead she will be undergoing a mastectomy with a recovery time of 4 to 6 weeks. This means that Ange will be unable to work and Rich will need to stay home to take care of both her and their son, meaning income will be almost nonexistent.
Any funds raised will go directly towards supporting Ange and her family with living expenses, including rent, utilities, groceries and childcare supplies.

6 March 2024
On the 20th Feb Ange accompanied by her husband went to Wellington hospital blood and cancer clinic for her first round of chemotherapy treatment. She met with her oncologist prior to starting her treatment and was given the devastating news that neither of them were expecting.
Ange has been told her cancer has spread to her bones, specifically her spine and also her right shoulder. There's also a suspicious looking cyst on her kidney that they are investigating. Further tests are needed to confirm their suspicions, however they are fairly certain this is the case.
Because of this, her treatment plan has changed and they think there is little to no point having the mastectomy, as sadly, the bone cancer is incurable.
This means Ange will spend the rest of her life being treated for cancer. With the average life expectancy of only 3-5 years for those with bone cancer. Ange is now determined to fight even harder than before so she can defy this and be there to watch her little man grow.

Within 24hrs of seeing a Specialist, Chris had surgery to remove the top part of her ear, followed by a 2nd operation 3 weeks later resulting in the total loss of her ear.
The tumour has now returned in the same place. There is no more surgery or talk of radiotherapy for now. Keytruda is the only anti-cancer drug recommended and requires infusions every 3 weeks for 17 cycles (1 year). It is not funded in NZ and the drug alone costs $77,000 for the year plus $25k for administering this drug, use of the oncology, equipment and nurses time.
Chris and her husband Brett are facing a tremendously tough time ahead financially. When I approached them about the Give a Little Page they were very reluctant to go down this path until reality sunk in.
Chris is a very generous person of her time, having served the Morrinsville community incl Meals on Wheels.
She has been a motivator for me and together we've done a half marathon, and other various fun runs. While undergoing Keytruda she still pushes herself to stay fit and healthy attending pilates, gym classes and going on bush walks with Brett even when she is feeling tired.
To alleviate the financial burden for Chris and her family, I am hoping to fully fund her Keytruda through this page.
A big thank you in advance for your kindness and support.

Hi all, Chris’ skin graft on her ear has nearly healed after the last op. You’ll see in the photo a round black area, that’s part of the skin graft. This top will come off so it’ll then look like new skin.
However, the Radiology Oncologist is wanting to see Chris next week to discuss whether to proceed with radiotherapy or not … and so the journey continues.
A friend kindly donated two nights away at his bach at Oamaru Bay in the Coromandel for a raffle which raised $1,300 towards Chris’ cancer. It’s great to see everyone getting behind her. Again she’d like to thank everyone for their support.

Update on Chris' third surgery
19 May 2024
Hi All, Chris has been recovering from her third op having more melanoma removed around and inside her ear canal. A skin graft was used from skin on her neck. Very clever work by the surgeon although the skin graft is still very swollen and dark looking until the top skin falls off. He did a great job taking skin from her neck which is healing very nicely. With the swelling she couldn’t hear, until the surgeon inserted a tube into her ear. It’s amazing what can be done.
Again, she’d like to thank everyone so much for their generous donations and the meals, flowers and heart felt wishes sent. This support gives Chris the encouragement to remain positive to face the challenges ahead.

An update from Chris
7 May 2024
Hi all, Chris came out of hospital yesterday. Just three days after her three-monthly Pet scan Chris was booked in for more surgery to remove additional melanoma from around her ear and inside her ear canal. A skin graft was needed from her neck, skin grafts can be more painful than the surgery. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees this time that the melanoma won't come back.
The surgeon has told Chris that when this heals, she will require 4-6 weeks of radiotherapy and then back onto the Keytruda treatments for another 9 months.
We all would like to thank everyone who has either given donations, offers of help and very importantly, emotional support which is much appreciated. A number of people we don’t even know have given donations and also sent heart felt wishes, this has been extremely overwhelming, and the family just can’t thank everyone enough.
Chris is such a fighter and for the first time has had to stop work this week but hopes to be back next week.

Update on Juliet
18 November 2023
Hi anyone who's is following Juliets journey 😁
She was discharged home from the hospital on Monday (13th November), so now has to travel backwards and forwards to the hospital for all of her chemo treatments.
Shes almost finished phase 1 of her 29 day treatment plan and has had a bone marrow biopsy to find out weather or not the first phase of chemo has worked or not.
Phase 2 is another 29 day plan with more chemo that is guaranteed to make her feel lousy and miserable.
Phase 2 will obliterate her immune system and leave her extremely vulnerable to sickness 😷
Notes about visiting her at home:
Please do not come near her or the household if you have a cough, cold, sniffles, diarrhoea etc etc etc, as she would like to win her battle not loose it because of someone's negligence and well wishes.
Thank you 💚💚💚

On the positive side we are just going through things day by day and he has been a real trooper with all the treatments and procedures. We are now at home the majority of the time going into hospital as required for chemo and procedures. It is a long journey that we are embarking on, the total course of treatment and monitoring is 2.5 years.

We are reaching out to you to save my brother's life, who is in ventilator support and is in ICU, based in Kerala, India,. He is currently facing a daunting battle against pancreatitis, a condition that has brought him to the brink of his strength and endurance. To make matters worse, he has also endured the harrowing complications of sepsis and septic shock, turning his fight into an uphill battle against time.
My brother is the sole breadwinner for his family, which includes his widowed mother, his wife, and his 7-year-old son. With his illness, things have become increasingly difficult. Up until now, my sister, relatives, friends, and I have been pooling money together for his medical expenses. However, we've reached a point where we can no longer afford to do so.
As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, Nevin's medical expenses began to mount. Additionally, he has been transferred from one hospital to another in pursuit of better treatment. The cost of his treatment was staggering, totaling 1500 NZD per day, and we are struggling to keep up with the financial burden. That's why we are turning to you, our community, for support for his life.
Every donation, no matter how small, brings us one step closer to our goal of ensuring Nevin's continued access to medical care.
Please consider donating to Nevin's medical fund and sharing his story with your friends, family, and community.

I'm Moss, I'm 19 years old and I am a trans man. I was born and raised in Wellington, New Zealand and still live here.
I've been out as a trans man for four years now, and have known I was trans for many more. I've spent most of my life feeling uncomfortable and disconnected from myself. When I came out as trans, I was able to show more of who I am. I've gotten more comfortable expressing my gender and identity however I am still struggling with major gender dysphoria surrounding my chest.
My chest has been and still is one of the main causes of my dysphoria and heavily impacts my mental health. I struggle to feel confident as I am always conscious of how my body looks and my feminine features.
I've been saving for top surgery since I was 15, but have been struggling to save what I need as I still have living costs which makes it difficult to save.
Top surgery is a gender affirming medical procedure. Due to the wait time for top surgery in New Zealand and the positive impact it will have on my life, I have decided to go private. The effect of having a feminine chest has been getting worse and has severely drained my mental health as I've waited.
My surgeon is Rita Yang at Wakefield Hospital, and the estimated cost of the surgery and recovery is $32,000 NZD, excluding previous appointments. My goal is to get the surgery in August of 2024 if possible.

She unfortunately had to spend her 80th birthday in bed at Christchurch hospital. Since December she has worked incredibly hard to overcome the effects of the stroke which has left her unable to walk without support and supervision. She has had to learn how to feed herself again and has lost the ability to simple daily tasks like prepare her own food and go to the bathroom by herself.
My mother was born in Fiji and is technically a citizen of the USA, but has no permanent home due to unforeseen circumstances so for many years she bounced between families in Australia, Fiji, and NZ. Since April 2021 she has been living with me on an extended visitor's visa, but I am an NZ citizen and the end goal is for my mum to to be a permanent resident here so she can have some stability and a place to call home.
Because she isn't a permanent resident yet, 3 weeks ago we received an enormous bill for her time spent in hospital, which has totalled $95,365. I have no regrets about getting treatment for my mum as she deserves to continue living a life with some independence, but it has come at a cost that we unfortunately cannot afford alone.

Tonight Link will have been in ICU, sedated and intubated, for 2 weeks. His recovery is slow going, although there have been improvements.
Today they've lowered his required oxygen to 35%. Previously it had been hovering between 50% to 90%, so this is a huge improvement if he can maintain this level of oxygen.
He's become quite resistant to a lot of his sedation drugs, which has become problematic. They've switched up his drugs a bit, he's on so many I can't totally remember what's changed. I know he's on ketamine and oxycodone now though, which has helped a lot. He'll go through withdrawal symptoms once he's off the drugs, which will be rough.
As of today things are looking positive, but we're not getting out hopes up just yet.

Lincoln has finally tested negative for covid. We've now been moved out of an isolation room after 11 days in ICU.
They've changed his breathing tube from his mouth to a nasal one, which is meant to be more comfortable and less disturbing for him.
Although he's still sedated, he's doing his best to fight against his sedation. Often moving his arms and head, which we really don't want him to be doing yet.
He's been improving slowly, but he's still a very unwell wee guy.

Lincoln is doing well, all things considered. We've been at Starship for 3 days now, and we've been told he's improved since he arrived here, although it's all small improvements, and he has a way to go yet.
I'll update here again when there's something worth mentioning, but I don't expect much to change over the weekend.
Again, a huge thank you for all the support ❤️

I am working on some really fun and exciting things with the help of some amazing people in our community. This exciting thing I am planning is I will be putting up some items for Auction, with the Auction date as the 3rd July. TBC where the Auction will take place.

23 days to go until the end of my ""OFF WITH MY HAIR"" Fundraiser for the Breast Cancer foundation.
12 June 2024
The last 22 days have been fun and exciting. I hit $3,000 in donations at the weekend, and I am eager for us to get more. There has been some amazing support shown and I am super grateful for all that we are doing for this cause.
I wonder if you know where the money that is donated to the Breast Cancer Foundation goes. I did a bit of research before choosing to go with them and now I want to share with you where the funds get allocated.
Research including Te Rēhita Mate Ūtaetae, the Breast Cancer Foundation National Register, and critical studies to improve survivorship.
Education and awareness in communities so more breast cancers are detected early and lives saved.
Support for women with breast cancer including an 0800 specialist breast nurse advice line, counselling and rehab services following surgery.
Advocacy to improve access to mammogram screening, diagnosis, treatment and care.
Project reserves to ensure long-term programmes can be sustained and new opportunities actioned.
Admin
Fundraising
On Friday 5th July at midday, my Givealittle page will be closed. That afternoon, if we have reached the major milestone of raising $15,000, I will be shaving my hair as a final testament to each and every one of you that have shown support and encouraged me during this time.
Any donations, big and small, is appreciated more than you could ever know.

Working Together to Help Michelle Kick the Butt out of Cancer!,Michelle urgently needs our support to afford life-extending immunotherapy treatment after exhausting other medical options.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/90c35117-2a0d-44e4-a156-b16500c189c9-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/working-together-to-help-michelle-kick-butt,8575.0,60000.0,303 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/working-together-to-help-michelle-kick-butt,9 May 2024,3 May 2025,1,"Palmerston North, Manawatu-Wanganui",79,"Michelle is one of those rare and special people who leaves an impact on all those she meets. She is a passionate and dedicated early childhood teacher. Michelle is battling cancer and needs our community to support her as she has supported so many.
In May 2023, Michelle's world turned upside down when she was diagnosed with Stage 4 Mestatic Anal Cancer. Braving the reality of a terminal illness with no chance of a cure and it being too late for surgery or radiotherapy, Michelle's only chance of more time was to complete an intensive 6 months of chemotherapy (Paclitaxel and Carboplatin) which resulted in many tumours reducing in size. Before long, the cancer mutated and came back aggressively resulting in less than 12 months to live even with the trial of a different chemotherapy drug (Cisplatin). Michelle's only hope now of gaining more time with her family, is the unfunded but effective immunotherapy drug (Ketruda) at the staggering cost of $9000 every 3 weeks.
Mindful of not putting pressure on others, Michelle and her family have been determined to raise as much of the immunotherapy funds as possible. They have contributed $42,000 of the total $100k cost. The financial reality is now hitting home. Michelle has had to give up the job she loves. With encouragement from family and friends, Michelle is now humbly allowing us to set up a Givealittle page. Michelle is inspirational in her positivity and grateful for every donation. Let’s buy her the time she needs.

Ngā mihi nui maioha ki a koutou katoa! Huge amounts of appreciation to all of you!
I have been so extremely humbled by your thoughts, messages, and sharing of my post to raise more awareness of Anal Cancer. I am extremely grateful for all of your donations - wow! Almost $6,000 will pay for 2/3 of one cycle of immunotherapy which is just amazing. 🙂
I have just started my fourth round chemotherapy and completed two cycles of immunotherapy. I wanted to share some photos of me being supported by my 'little' brother who travelled from Alba/Scotland this last week. We haven't seen each other since our mother passed of pancreatic cancer in 2015 so it is a super special time together now. 🙂 As the baby of the family, his nick name is 'Boo Boo Bear', a name he has come round to over the years 🤣 and replicated in his T shirt of support.
Scans in the coming weeks will give us some idea of the impact of chemo and immuno ... wish me luck! 🙂

Kylie asks
Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

Since then he has been in and out of the hospital with 2 cycles of chemotherapy and dealing with the side effects and contracting E-Coli.
Despite Jeremy nearing remission, he had a setback and the chemotherapy is no longer working and another cycle would cause other health issues. Jeremy has been allowed to try two drugs, Azacitidine and Venetoclax, however, they aren't funded and they are expensive.
Jeremy and his wife have two children, the youngest was born two years ago and has a lifelong physical disability. This has resulted in Jeremy's wife needing to be a stay-at-home mum to care for their youngest full-time.
As Jeremy has been the main income earner, his health has now taken a considerable toll on their finances as he has been unable to work for the past four months, and day-to-day living has become a struggle, let alone trying to fund medication that is over a thousand dollars a month.
We ask for any assistance anyone can offer to help Jeremy and his young family work through this tough period.

Daniel is friendly, caring and has never let it bring him down. (WAS) is a rare genetic immunodeficiency that keeps his immune system from functioning properly. It also makes it difficult for his bone marrow to produce platelets, making him prone to internal bleeding.
Daniels condition has now progressed to an autoimmune disease (Lupus, Vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease). The Lupus and Vasculitis was not picked up during previous testing in NZ and now a stem cell transplant must be done before it attacks his organs causing irreparable damage. This was found when we took Daniel to Thailand to be seen.
The doctors are continuing to treat the symptoms but the only cure and real hope for Daniel is a Stem Cell Transplant now. I found and contacted a specialist on (WAS). Prof Michael Albert in Munich, Germany.  Prof Albert contacted our immunologists in NZ and the result of that conversation is that Daniel needs a transplant.  It is a terrifying thought of what Daniel will go through in the future and that is why we are hoping to have the procedure done in Milan, Italy as that is where the BMT specialist is located. The cost of the transplant is €322,900 euro, plus outpatient medication for Daniel. During this process Daniel will spend 4-6 weeks in hospital and then 6 months or more as an outpatient with weekly check-ups twice a week.

So Daniel will most likely be having his transplant in Milan Italy.
We have been speaking to 2 Italian specialists at SAN Raffaele hospital about gene therapy which uses his own bone marrow and is the treated before being transplanted. The problem with gene therapy is it cost $2 million plus the transplant cost. The Italian specialist and German specialist are having a meeting on Wednesday 24th April regarding his treatment.
We would love to do gene therapy so we are trying to get as much help as we can.
If anyone has any ideas please feel free to contact us.

Right now, she is on a gruelling journey with cancer and needs our support.
In August 2022 Nat (46) was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She has spent the past year undergoing treatment and pouring all her energy into fighting this horrible disease. The first round of treatment in 2022 was very successful, while the most recent round has been a roller-coaster, with COVID thrown into the mix and the cancer still very much present.
Nat is an incredible mother to her two young boys (10 & 13) and a wonderful wife (to John), daughter, sister and friend who has consistently put the needs of others before her own. It's time for Nat to receive the care and support she needs and deserves to overcome this enormous battle.
With both Nat and John not working currently, any financial contributions towards the endless costs associated with treatment, medical accessories (bed, wheelchair, etc) and just making sure everyone is fed well will help to lighten the load a bit and will be massively appreciated.
Nat, John and the boys also need practical help with meals, lifts to & from treatments, etc. You can find details of their schedule and links to a mealtrain here: https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/nataliecook.
Positive thoughts, prayers and energy are also always welcome.
We know so many people, near and far, want to help and hopefully this provides some direction for your efforts. Thank you so much.

14 October 2023
It's been some time since we created this page and a lot has changed, but I just want to say a huge thank you, on behalf of Nat, John and the boys, (and all of us) to everyone who has contributed in any way to help Nat and her family.
Every message of love and support, every meal or tasty treat, cup of tea or coffee, hug, smile, lift, helping hand and cent has been so gratefully received and helped ease this journey a little.
The exceptionally generous financial contributions raised via Givealittle have enabled Nat to receive treatments that have helped her in her fight against cancer, as well as helped to bring her some relief from symptoms and discomfort. They have also allowed Nat & John (and all of us) the privilege of having an incredible end-of-life doula walk this path with us and make it just a little smoother, calmer and more manageable. I honestly don't want to think about how different things would have been up to this point if we had been doing this on our own. Nat has said that making contact with the doula was the best decision she made, and I will forever be grateful for that, too.
We don't know exactly what lies ahead right now, but we are taking it one moment at a time.
Nat does check her phone, but has limited energy to engage, so may not respond to messages. Please know that she appreciates them all, though. You're also welcome to reach out to me directly if you'd like me to pass on a message or answer a question.
With love and gratitude,

From the high kicks, jokes, and singing, Sarah’s lust for life is more infectious than a venereal disease.

To help while Sarah endures intense chemotherapy in the hope of prolonging life, her 77-year-old, gorgeous mother, Margie, has packed up her life and flown over from the UK to help her daughter and care for Miles as Sarah cannot.
We’re desperate to keep Sarah around for as long as possible, for Miles, Margie, and all of her friends who are all the better for knowing her.

Anyone who knows Kiri, Scott, Reid and Emmie (Team Walker) know how tight this whānau is. They always go the extra mile for each other, their friends and their community. They laugh together, work together, and now they fight together.
Kiri is the glue that holds this family together. She’s strong, kind, fiercely protective and incredibly humble. She’s the first to offer help and the last to take it, that’s what makes this request so difficult.
Much of the Kapiti community know Team Walker in one way or another, either from the sports clubs they’ve been involved in, the volunteer Fire Service, Reid and Emmie’s school or Kiri’s work within the community - which she has recently had to put a hold on due to ill health.
Six weeks ago, Kiri started feeling unwell after further tests, Kiri was diagnosed with advanced Cervical Cancer!
Team Walker is a private family, they’d rather help others than ask for help themselves, with Kiri not being able to work for the foreseeable future and Scott needing to take time out from the family business they bought seven months ago, they need financial support to make day-to-day living costs.
As a lifelong friend of Kiri’s, i can say she is fiercely independent, she took some (I mean a lot) of persuading to let people show their aroha for her and her beautiful whānau in any way they can.
PS. F*** you cancer, you’re not having this one!

14 June 2024
Firstly, on behalf of Kiri and Team Walker, from the bottom of their hearts, thank you. Your donations, messages, gifts, love and support mean more than you can ever imagine.
In the 6 weeks since diagnosis, Kiri's prognosis has become clearer and, not to put too fine a point on it, her treatment options are limited; surgery and radiation are not possible.
Four weeks ago, Kiri had a one-off treatment of radiotherapy to help regenerate her blood and allow her body to recover enough to start the chemotherapy that will fight the cancer. Kiri is now fit enough to start her first round of chemotherapy, which will happen every 3 weeks for the next 3 months.
As you know, the government recently reneged on their pledge to fund vital cancer drugs in NZ. This news came as Kiri was told of an additional treatment that could prolong her life significantly, but it comes at a huge cost: approx $6k per treatment given in conjunction with chemotherapy. This drug (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab) will give Kiri extra precious time with her family and while she will start it with chemo, it can continue once chemo has stopped, however the cost per visit remains the same. The good news is that the total cost is capped at $52k, which means that Kiri can continue once the cap is reached.
Thanks again for all your support. I appreciate that we have asked a lot from our families and friends, and we are once again asking if you can dig even deeper to help Kiri get as much precious time as she can with Reid, Emmy and Scott. ❤️

She has a CT scan booked for end of May to check some unusual pain in her left rib bones.
On 5th August, Larissa Allen (age 31) was diagnosed with Grade 3, Triple Negative, Metaplastic breast cancer.
Larissa is a wonderful mum to her 4 year old son, Carter. He is her greatest motivator to beat this disease & stay alive for as long as possible.
The type of cancer Larissa has is rare & agressive. It is only found in less than 1% of all breast cancer cases. Due to the rarity, there are very little treatments available to her.
After having her mastectomy, chemotherapy is next. It is gruelling & as a single mum of one, Larissa knows she is going to need all the help she can get.
There is a low survival rate with metaplastic cancer & an average reoccurrence of cancer within 18 months-3 years. It unfortunately spreads through the blood to other areas of the body - predominantly brain, lungs and liver.
We can’t imagine the nightmare Larissa is living through. Even in her darkest moments she has been recording her journey through her platform on social media to provide comfort, knowledge & support to others on their own journey with cancer.
Larissa’s beaming smile & positivity never ceases to amaze her friends & family despite going through the unimaginable.
PLEASE - let’s do all we can to support Larissa and Carter during this extremely difficult time. Your support is hugely appreciated.

7 May 2023
The past 9 months have been extremely difficult, but your support has made this experience a little less stressful.
With the mastectomy and chemotherapy, I had many months where I had to work reduced hours, so the funds raised went a long way to keep the household bills paid - thank you so much!
I was also able to buy a few wigs for when I lost my hair, pay for all the medical prescriptions and medicine as well as a couple of specialised massages which were so needed during chemotherapy.
I am currently sitting here with no evidence of disease, which still feels a little surreal. I continue to struggle with fatigue and brain fog, as well as some nerve damage to my hands - thanks chemo! And I also have some bone pain. This was recently investigated with a full body MRI. All areas were clear, except for my left ribs - which are being further investigated with a CT scan at the end of May.
To take my mind off of the wait, I am off to Thailand for 2 weeks - a chance for me to relax, reset and process this crazy ride I've been on. Luckily, I'll be able to show my new hair do as it had started to grow back.
I continue to visualise a future where I'm alive and thriving & I'm not taking any time for granted. It is full steam ahead - I don't want to miss out on anything. I auditioned for an acting scholarship when I was completing chemotherapy - I was feeling like I was on death's door when I auditioned but it turns out the judges loved it, and I won a scholarship to go study at a prestigious acting school in New York for six weeks. I start in July - I can't wait!
There is certainly lots to live for and lots to look forward to.
Thank you again for all your love, support and kind well wishes - it takes a team to kick cancer's butt - so thank you for being on my team.
Lots of love,
Larissa

Mastectomy done & dusted
27 September 2022
On 12 September, Larissa underwent a four hour surgery to remove her left breast and a 21mm metaplastic tumour. They removed some muscle and lymph nodes for testing which have come back clear.
The surgery was a success and the tumour was removed with good margins. The nipple was able to be spared and a new breast was reconstructed with an implant.
Larissa has been healing well and is getting a little more mobility back in her left side, two weeks on from surgery.
Next step is chemo and we will know more information on what type and when it will start, come the 5th October.
The pathology report has confirmed it is triple negative metaplastic breast cancer meaning it won’t be responsive to hormone treatment.
The best plan of attack will be regular testing and scans to catch a reoccurrence early and this will be discussed at her follow up appointment.

Thank you for your support
6 September 2022
I’m five days out from having my mastectomy. It has been a very fast turnaround and for that I am very grateful - I can’t fault the medical care received so far.
I am also grateful for all the support I have been receiving during this difficult and overwhelming time.
Thank you so much for your support. I feel a simple thank you just doesn’t cut it.
I never thought I would be here in this situation, with cancer and needing to ask for help. I’m a pretty head strong independent woman so your support means more to me that I can ever express in words.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your kindness you have shown me and my little family.
This money will help me to maintain some normalcy for my son, Carter and allow us to enjoy the time we have together (however long that might be).
This money will mean I can pay for any treatments that I might need that aren’t funded, it’ll help me buy wigs for when I lose my hair, surgical bras for after my mastectomy, the extra travel costs for the endless hospital visits and soooo much more.
Your support is not taken for granted and I will continue to fight for my life and while doing it, advocate for other breast cancer survivors & fighters.
Lots of love,
Larissa x

For those who do not know me, my name is Anthea Vache. I am a young trans woman of Jamaican, Dominican & English descent. Born in East London (Leytonstone, UK) and raised in Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington, NZ) a place that I have called home since I was 6 years old.
As a loud and expressive child, I used to twirl around with a towel wrapped up on my head, imagining myself with long, flowing hair. Playing dress-up, fantasising my life as a real life Barbie, or a Polly Pocket, or as my favourite Bratz dolls - I have always known that I was one of the girls.
I am truly blessed and grateful to be surrounded by family and friends who have supported me throughout my journey into womanhood, most importantly my mum.
Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
I am travelling to Thailand to complete my gender-affirming surgery in order to finally feel at peace with my physical self, and to continue living my life confidently as the woman that I have always been, spiritually.
I have been very fortunate to have saved enough money to fund my surgery costs with the help of my family; however, I am hoping to raise additional funds to support me during my post-surgery recovery.
The money that I hope to raise from here will cover everyday expenses post-op during the remainder of our time in Thailand.
I don’t ask for much, but if you are able to help with some of the expenses whether big or small, I am truly grateful for the love and support xo

In November, we received the devastating news of Steve being diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia.
This news has completely upended our lives, including those of our seven children.

As a result, we are faced with leaving our home and lives on the beautiful west coast for an unforeseen period of time. Additionally, we have had to rehome our beloved pets, enrol our children in new schools/daycare and establish new relationships as we reimagine our life's path.
Steve's treatment will span at least six to eighteen months, encompassing challenging chemotherapy sessions, daily blood transfusions, and chemo injected into his spine. It is undeniably a cruel and arduous journey that lies ahead.

Steve is going well and we are all preparing for his upcoming stem cell transplant. This replaces his whole immune system with a donors cells from Germany. Steve will have a new blood type and will need to be on antirejection drugs. Prior to the transplant he will need to have more chemo and some total body radiation therapy. Hopefully this will give him the best chance at life and keeping the leukaemia at bay.

February update
22 February 2024
“The poisoning continues until the health improves” is one of Steve’s quotes here.
A tough few weeks- the intensification chemo has been the most gruelling so far.
We are now awaiting the results of the bone marrow biopsy which will determine the path of treatment.
Steve’s brother is a donor for a stem cell transplant- Steve’s best chance for the future.
We are so grateful this is on the cards.
Thank you everyone for your support and messages, meals, check ins, listening ears and the donations via this page.
The funds have been extremely helpful as we navigate this stressful time.
Steve is ok- I am so proud of how strong and resilient he is.
Love to you all
Anne

Steve is now on the intensification round of chemotherapy- another 28 days of being in hospital. Luckily, he had 2 weeks off prior and we got to spend time with his parents who travelled from the USA. Thank you everyone for your love and support at this awful time for us.

Update from Steve
1 January 2024
Hope you all had a great night ringing in 2024 and looking at what happened in the year gone by.
Pretty quiet here. I crashed early and woke at half 11 to everyone else in bed. I then sat on the balcony and listened to the new year being rung in at the Park.
Not trying to sound selfish but it was nice to sit in the dark and reflect on the last few months with its downs and ups and take note of all the amazing people who have extended a hand or kind words to Anne and myself.
Words, nor messages can reflect the gratitude we have for every action or message of support we have received since we found out our lives had been tipped on its side.
Thank you all. From the depths of our hearts.
We really appreciate everything that has been done to support Anne, myself and the extended family.
Steve

Recently, he has been faced with a significant health challenge, a journey none should walk alone. It's our turn to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ryan, offering our support just as he always does for us.
Ryan, a father of 3, was diagnosed with multiple cancer issues in October ‘23, this came as a shock to all of us who know him as vibrant, energetic, and always the first to lend a helping hand. Ryan has been doing the hard yards over the last few months working his way through treatment. The road ahead is uncertain and fraught with challenging times, and the inevitable financial burden such a condition brings with it. But in this moment of vulnerability, we also see an opportunity for hope and collective action.
This Give a little campaign is more than just a fundraiser—it's a way to tautoko and show support for Ryan. Every donation, no matter the size, will go directly towards Ryan's expenses, ensuring he can focus on what's most important: healing and recovery.
Your generosity and thoughts mean the world to us and, most importantly, to Ryan. Let's show him that no one has to face hardship alone—we are all whanau.
Nga Mihi nui from the bottom of our hearts for your tautoko and aroha for Ryan. Keep healing my G!

Yolanda has always been generous to everyone. Yolanda is held in high regard by many in the community for her kindness and support for those in need. She is a natural empath who relishes any opportunity to help those around her. Typically, if she is not caring for the elderly, she is most likely taking someone else under her wings. She is an earth Angel to so many lives over the years. Her talents brought so much joy to many Filipino weddings, birthdays and celebration events. Yolanda invests a lot of time nurturing her faith and love for those close to her. Not only she is loved dearly in the Pinoy community but holds a special spot with her Samoan family through her husband.
Yolanda is now facing her greatest battle against cancer (liver and lungs). Her medical prognosis is very dire and life-threatening. Yolanda will need additional medicines to go with her regular chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the additional medicines are not funded. The treatment plan alone applicable to her case will have an estimated cost of NZ$53,000.00. To cover this plus any additional financial needs during her course of recovery, we need to raise NZ$75,000.00.
As you all have experienced, in one way or another, Yolanda has always been there for us. Now it's time for us to be there for her. This is a call to all friends and family to support Yolanda during this time. Any contribution will be a real blessing. Thank you for your love and generosity.

28 May 2024
For all those who have reached out to Yolanda in the past months, through their generous donations and prayers, Yolanda would like to express ""a warm heartfelt, thank you"". Words will never be enough to express Yolanda's gratitude to everyone and it means the world to her to know that this medical battle, though challenging, is a sickness she does not have to go through alone, and that she is consistently surrounded by her husband, her family, friends from work, Church, and personal friends from all over the world.
Last 22 May 2024, Yolanda had her 6th chemotherapy and her 5th Avastin sessions. For the past 6 sessions, the side effects of the chemotherapy medicines have been varied. There would be good days where Yolanda is able to proceed with her normal day-to-day routine and there would be not-so-good days, when she is tired, light-headed and lethargic, dizzy, constipated and may experience cold and hot spells.
Amid all of these, Yolanda remains positive and steadfast in her faith and her community are unwavering in their prayers. Her team of oncologists will be re-assessing Yolanda's treatment plan on 30 May 2024, the doctors will determine the next steps to take for Yolanda's medical treatment. We remain hopeful. Please continue to pray for Yolanda. God bless you!

Thank you
18 April 2024
On behalf of Yolanda, thank you very much for your generous donations, your prayers, and your kind messages. It brings so much encouragement to her knowing that she is surrounded with family, friends and a community who wishes her well, and having that assurance that she doesn’t have to go through this alone.
It’s been nearly 2 months since she started chemotherapy and she completed 3 sessions already. Each session was different as her body is adjusting to the additional chemotherapy medicines (Cetuximab). Yolanda will be completing the remaining 11 chemo sessions in the coming months.
Again, our sincere appreciation to all of you for sharing your love, prayers and support through this page. Please continue to pray for Yolanda. God bless you!!!

On March 15 2019, she and her husband were present at their local mosque when tragedy struck and was shot by a terrorist. Amidst the chaos and heartbreak of the attacks, Habiba stood as a witness with her daughter to the horrors that unfolded, forever altering her and her family's lives.
Recently, Habiba received another devastating blow, being diagnosed with cancer in her neck and head, nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This courageous woman, who has already endured so much, now faces an arduous battle against this relentless disease. Her children look to her for comfort, but the path ahead is fraught with challenges.
Habiba’s husband is doing everything he can to support the family, but the health and daily expenses are mounting. The community that once thrived together is now rallying to provide the support she desperately needs. This is where we can all step in and make a difference.
By contributing to this fund, you are also also providing hope and stability to her 3 children during this difficult time. Every little bit helps, and together, we can ensure that Habiba continues to fight with the love and support of a united community.
Please give generously and share Habiba’s story. Let's come together to support a mother, a survivor, and a beacon of resilience in our community.

This is a rare primary brain cancer, and he was airlifted to Starship from Whangarei. Aiden had an MRI which showed a large tumour, alongside this came the complex location of it. After an 8 hour surgery, Aiden began having frequent seizures over a 48-hour period. A 2nd surgery was required where a drain was placed to help the fluid/pressure build up in his brain, and then following this has had a third surgery to add a permanent shunt in to his brain.
Aiden is currently spending time in Starship recovering. They have held off with this page in the hopes that they would be back home by now, but with the next part of treatment, their little family will be in Starship for months. Aiden is now facing a long course of Radiotherapy to beat this cancer which after recovering from his 3 surgeries, Radiotherapy will begin to give him the best chance at beating this. The specialists in Starship are currently deciding if Florida or Auckland will provide him with the best treatment. This is due to the cancer being in such a difficult part of the brain to treat and his young age.
Pete and Alyse have had to leave their farm which is 4 hours away from Starship and rely on family to care for the farm as get ready for calving. Aiden will need 24/7 care and we wait for Aiden’s little sibling to arrive in October.

Hi Everyone,
Just a little update to let you know how life is going for Lee and us as a family :)
We had another minor setback over the holidays as we all got covid, this was particularly difficult for Lee as at first we thought he had relapsed to pre procedure state, but his specialist thought it sounded like Covid and reassured us she had seen covid do this to other patients before and not to worry.
Lee is just dealing with the tail end of covid, but is back up and about again and yesterday took the kiddies out on his own for the first time in a very very very long time for an icecream, photo attached :)
He is starting all his therapies this week (accupuncture, hydrotherapy, physio and gym work under a pain physio).
Thank you all again for your incredible generousity, it looks like our life is finally starting to get on track and we just wanted to express once again our gratitude for all of you.
Huge love,

Recovery day 1
5 April 2024
Yesterday Lee went in to Greenlane to have his procedure.
His amazing specialist went out of her way to make time for him at the end of the day, when all of the front office staff had gone home. An hour and a half later the procedure was complete. The specialists first words were ""Yay, no major back surgery"". (which we didn't even know was on the cards if it didn't work!).
This morning Lee walked into the kitchen and hugged our kiddos. I will never forget the glimmer in their eyes looking at their Daddy, their Daddy is back.
We don't know what the future holds, and Lee is still very sore post surgery... but Lee has allot of work to do to try and get back the 10+kg of muscle he has lost over the last 9 months, and will need allot of therapies. But he will do it, and we are all soooooo positive now for the future.
This would not have been possible without all of you, thank you so very very much.
Huge Love,

Words just cannot express the overwhelming feelings, and the outpour of love, kindness, care, understanding, generousity and selflessness we have received over the last few days, after battling for so long in survival as a family. Despite being in isolation for the last 9 months, Lee has never felt less alone and full of love than this last few days.
We had the most beautiful moment yesterday when we told our children that Daddy will be able to play with them again soon, so many tears released but so much love and joy.
We feel like we can see the light coming, finally.
We love you all.

He was a fit healthy non-smoker and very active person. In July 2022 he was diagnosed with stage 4 Lung Cancer with a mutation ALK. His cancer diagnoses turned our world upside down. Luckily he was ALK positive so could try a targeted medication. He was put on an inhibitor Alectinib, which is funded by Pharmac and it worked for 1.5 years before progression occurred. The tumour grew from 21X19mm (Oct 2023) to 42X44mm (Feb 2024). The tumour, partially blocking his airway, is inoperable due to being right beside the heart. We are putting all our hope on the meds. The only option left in NZ is chemo with a 29% chance of a response and working for around 3 months.
So we looked outside NZ for help and paid for a 3 months supply of the generation 3 inhibitor, Lorlatinib, which was taken off compassionate ground here in Dec 2022.
He started taking Lorlatinib this January with a very positive response. We sourced the Lorlatinib overseas for around $3500 NZD for 30 days meds which is a serious struggle for us to afford.
A generation 4 ALK inhibitor is already being trialled so we sure want Mark to stay in the game for our precious kids.
Any donations are very appreciated more than you know. Thank you for reading.

9 April 2024
*UPDATE 9: My apologies for the delayed update. Joan is still residing at Puawai Rehabilitation Unit in Dunedin. She has recently recovered from Covid and is still being cared for by the team there.
I am continuing to travel to see her as much as possible.
Mum's mobility has improved and she is now able to move without hoists and wheelchairs. Unfortunately her cognitive function has not improved for some time so we are looking at her next space for her care being in a dementia ward rather than hospital level care. I have been trying to get her closer to Central Otago for some time but have met some obstacles with the level of care Mum needs, I am hopeful a vacancy will come up soon to lead to an improvement in Joan's quality of life.
She's missing the gardens, pets, grandbabies and her friends and looks forward to visitors.
We're so so grateful for all the support shown to us during this journey and as it continues.
It means so much to Mum, myself and our family. I will let you know when I can secure a space for Joan and look forward to seeing you all when visiting starts closer to home 🤞🏼🤍

UPDATE 7: Joan has remained stable enough to be transferred to Puāwai Rehabilitation Centre in Dunedin. This is a live-in facility that will provide Mum with speech&language therapy, cognitive, occupational therapy and physiotherapy while ensuring her medical needs are also met.
Joan has fought a huge battle since the 14th of December and we're continually amazed by her strength and determination. Thank you all for your unwavering support throughout this journey.
It has meant so much to Joan and our family and will continue to as we see what the next weeks bring 🤍

Such great news. Keep up the fight Joan. Stay strong family. X
Update 6
7 January 2024
Joan has been transferred to Dunedin Hospital and has unfortunately been very drowsy with a low GCS the last few days.
Her blood pressure has risen above where the doctors would prefer so they've given her medication to try to help with this.
They are going to perform another CT scan to see if it can provide any answers towards Mums healthcare plan.
The staff are hoping she is not declining and are providing her with all necessary support they can at this time..
Please contact Liv directly if you would like to visit Joan and I can provide details. Thank you 🤍

UPDATE 5: Day21: Joan sure is a strong woman! Mum has been transferred back to the neurosurgery HDU after her stay in ICU. They've been working on keeping her blood pressure up without the help of medication now and currently Joan is responding well 🙌🏼
The plan is to keep her stable enough to transfer to Dunedin Hospital in the near future 🙏🏼 We are hopeful and encouraging Mum to keep up her strength and determination to get home.
What a rollercoaster it has been..Thank you so much for your love & support during Joan's journey 🤍

Oh that's great news to hear, She sure is a fighter alright🤍
Update 4.
30 December 2023
*UPDATE 4: Joan has undergone 5 Brain surgeries in her time in Christchurch Hospital.
When Mum came out of yesterday's surgery (where they inserted a permanent shunt from brain to abdomen) she was struggling a lot more to speak.
The doctors picked up on this along with tremors and weakness. They've taken her for an angiogram and discovered she has gone into Vasospasm.
A vasospasm is the narrowing of the arteries in the brain, caused by a persistent contraction of the blood vessels. This means blood is not flowing in her brain properly and affecting her speech and function massively.
She's now in I.C.U where she will spend at least 2 days undergoing a procedure to raise her blood pressure lots to hopefully help with the current vasospasm damage.
There's a big risk of mini strokes, which she possibly has already been having..or rupturing her aneurysms...however this is the only option she has to save her life right now so the doctors have to proceed.
Here's hoping for better news in 2024 🙏🏼
Thank you all for your Love 🤍 It is such a support for us all x

He suffers from convulsions and pervasive negative thoughts. Our youngest brother Mohammed is taking care of Ahmed now. After the Israeli army destroyed their house, they went to sleep at the door of the hospital, but Israel also attacked the hospital and they were forced to leave for the city of Rafah. Now there is heavy bombing in Rafah, and they do not even have a tent to protect them from the winter. They sleep on the wet ground among sewage water, in the rain.
Ahmed has a bachelor’s degree and has started his masters, but due to his illness he is unable to complete his studies. Mohammed has a bachelor’s degree in law and opened his own office one month before the war, but his dreams have been dashed and his office completely destroyed.
We have lost 28 people from my family. I have no one left except my two brothers. Please, help them!

Kidney for Life: Run for Ghana's First Transplant Unit,Sponsor me in the Leeds Half Marathon to support the establishment of the first kidney transplant unit in Ghana!,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/923d4fd1-4f08-422b-b3e0-b1410014292f-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/kidney-transplant-unit-ghana,7029.0,51119.0,85 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/kidney-transplant-unit-ghana,28 Mar 2024,27 Sep 2024,0,International,72,"I'm seeking your support to establish Ghana's first kidney transplant centre, providing a definitive treatment for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients.
This is personal to me for two reasons.
Firstly, CKD runs in my family. In 2021, I donated a kidney to my aunty Bid who had end-stage renal failure. While it involved a major surgery and postponing my Rhodes Scholarship, it pales in comparison with what CKD patients have to endure each day. I’ve personally witnessed how transformative kidney transplants can be; and my aunty Bid now leads a relatively normal life.
Secondly, during research at Tamale Teaching Hospital for my Masters thesis, I collaborated with Dr. Akis Afoko, a consultant urologist and founder of the renal dialysis unit. The hospital serves a population of over 4 million with only three functional dialysis machines. It's evident that the top barriers faced by CKD patients include the high cost of dialysis ($64 NZD/£30GBP per treatment), limited availability of dialysis centers, and the absence of kidney transplant services in the country.
Dr Akis Afoko is leading the work to create a kidney transplant unit in Northern Ghana, however, this comes at a significant cost, and they need our help!
To raise money for the unit, I am asking you to sponsor me to run the Leeds Half Marathon. I will also be running workshops (Oxford-based only) to teach elderflower cordial and/or fizz making. More information can be found here: https://forms.gle/wkBKFBBLfu7f7YWr5
Isabella Lenihan-Ikin's involvement (page creator)
Dr Akis Afoko, who supervised my Masters thesis and whom I worked with at the Tamale Teaching Hospital, leads this organisation (Le Mete) and has been leading this project to increase the capacity of renal services in this region of Ghana.
Use of funds
The funds will contribute to the cost of equipment needed to establish the unit (total cost: $51,119.97 NZD / £24,283.87 GBP). I’m hoping that together we can at least cover the cost of one dialysis machine ($9023.94 NZD / £4286.28 GBP).","The funds will contribute to the cost of equipment needed to establish the unit (total cost: $51,119.97 NZD / £24,283.87 GBP).

Her family thought it was an easy fix, but further tests revealed that she might have cancer. On Monday the 26th of February, Abigail went to Palmeston North to get her bone marrow tested, and on Tuesday the 27th of February, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. Chemotherapy started immediately that evening.
Abigail's journey to recovery has just begun, and it will be at least six months long. As many know, Abigail is also taking care of her one-year-old son, Atlas, who is very important to her. To protect herself during chemotherapy (which weakens immune system),she is keeping little man away from daycare so he can see his mother through out this difficult time. To enable Atlas to stay with Abigail, and to support her journey, family are taking turns traveling between New Plymouth and Palmeston North. Adam (her husband) needs to work part-time at his job in New Plymouth due to on-going financial obligations.
Living with illness can be incredibly difficult; therefore, any support given to Abigail and her family would be greatly appreciated, even if it means simply having them in your thoughts. The road to recovery may seem overwhelming at times, but knowing there are people behind you every step of the way makes all the difference.

Therapy will reduce it's spread if David responds super well.....if not, 2024 will be a short year for David. To the point, David has been told to anticipate 2023 is likely to be his last Christmas.

Recent hospital visit update
2 January 2024
Firstly thank you to everyone who has donated to the page, it was a tricky time of year to launch this page but we are so happy with the inital response.
Last Friday David had a follow up appointment with his surgeon......
No news is good news kinda thing. They were more checking on how David handled the last week. The surgeon is going to expeditie oncology to get into urgent treatment. He has also sent David's notes to Waikato, which has a more advanced cancer unit for a second opinion. He has advised David to not buy a plane ticket yet, as once oncology is locked and loaded, things will move more quickly. Apart from that they were happy there are no lingering symptoms with gut issues. Part of David did hope he would say they've discovered something that is favourable, but nah.. prognosis remains the same. It's shitty..no two ways about it, but David knew that anyway.
But if you have seen David's recent Instagram Story you will know he's facing this head on with the charismatic charm he's always had.
Please keep sharing this page and help us raise a lot of love.... till next time x

It saddens me to make this.
My dad had his appendix burst last year in April to then the doctors unexpectedly finding tumours and fluid which resulted in stage 4 advanced lung cancer after a biopsy taken in Christchurch.
It has been a living nightmare to say the least.
Unfortunately the treatment hasn’t worked for him and is incurable.
All donations will go towards the mortgage, bills, food, holidays and memories I would love to have with my dad before the opportunity is gone. He never asks for help but is the first person to lend a hand to anyone in need. Now it’s time for his hand to be held. Any small donation is a big contribute to help with our day to day life as I’ve given up work and moved home to be with him during this time.
I’m praying for a miracle to happen but that is yet to come. Thank you for your support❤️

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity and unfortunately we do not have many houses in the South Island so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best.

Kia Ora all,
I would like to again acknowledge all the love and generosity you have given our mama. Quick update Mama has been in hospice for the past 2 weeks for pain management and respite and she is doing well. She even had a visit from some of the Chief's and taught them some sign language. She has allocated some of the funds to her unofficial 60th birthday (which should have been in 2025) to celebrate with close friends and whanau. We have also brought my wedding date forward which she is in the throws of planning and a road trip with her mokopuna is also on the cards. She is excited and very motivated to make every moment special.

Tara is currently bedridden for most of the day and requires treatment to help ease her pain and nausea so that she can improve her quality of life in these final stages.
There is a treatment available that could help ease Tara’s symptoms but unfortunately it comes with a hefty price tag ($80,000).
We would appreciate your help in raising funds so any amount of money that you are able to donate would be greatly appreciated by Tara and her family and friends.

At only 32 Kat was diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma with a large mediastinal mass pressing against her heart and lungs.
Kat went to the doctors for a routine checkup and got sent for blood tests, that night she got a call from her GP saying she needed to go into Wellington Hospital the next morning for a CT. Little did Kat know she would stay in hospital for 4 Nights and got released on Christmas Eve. Four days later she was back in hospital to start urgent Chemotherapy (ABVD), with no time for egg freezing and has been in and out of hospital ever since.
After four Chemotherapy treatments Kat had an interim PET scan revealing that she wasn’t responding to the treatment. Kat is now on a different Chemotherapy regimen (Escalated BEACOPP) which requires a lot of trips to the hospital for treatment, is more toxic and produces more early and late side effects that will affect her quality and length of life. In turn this is affecting her ability to work. We are all hopeful that this treatment will be successful.
We are friends and work colleagues of Kats and have seen the pain and stress this diagnosis has caused Kat and her family. By setting up this Givealittle page we hope to relieve some of the financial pressure from Kat and her family so she can concentrate on fighting to get better.

It's been awful for me and other loved ones watching them go from just needing a cane to leave the house to relying on a manual wheelchair around 75% of the time.
Part of ME/CFS is post exertional malaise (PEM), meaning a massive worsening of pain and fatigue for days after only minimal exertion. Unfortunately, as their health has worsened, even pushing themself in their manual chair is resulting in bad flare ups, and due to joint hypermobility they have constant pain in their hands and shoulders from self propelling. This has led to them needing someone to push them while out of the house. As I am acting as their carer but I study full time, they are often house bound unless I take time off, which I am often unable to do. This loss of independence is significantly damaging their mental health, social wellbeing, and ability to do the things they need and want to do like going to appointments, doing shopping and seeing loved ones.
June is only able to work around 7 hours a week due to their health and our main source of income is the student allowance; despite us saving as much as we can, they need an electric wheelchair sooner than we are able to afford. We are hoping to raise enough to upgrade to an electric wheelchair which will give them the freedom to live a more normal life and conserve their limited energy.

Many of you are already aware of my battle with skin cancer.
To combat this, I have started a treatment called Keytruda, an anti-cancer (immunotherapy) drug that requires infusion every three weeks. However, this treatment is not covered by government funding in New Zealand, and the cost is incredibly high. Each three-week treatment amounts to $10,705. My health insurance, Southern Cross, covers $2,865, leaving me with a remaining cost of $7,840. The treatment may continue for up to two years, depending on how things progress. Currently, I have undergone three treatments, with another one scheduled for this Friday. Mentally, I remain determined to beat this disease, but physically, I am struggling, experiencing no visible changes and enduring extreme pain that requires painkillers.
I am more than grateful for any support you can provide, no matter how small. Your generosity will make a significant difference in my fight against this disease. Setting up a fund would be greatly appreciated, and I am touched by your kind-heartedness.
Thank you all for your unwavering support.

Her Family rushed to her side from Christchurch and the Coast arriving that afternoon, unsure of how she would be post surgery. Walking in to find her conscious was a huge relief. She was left with Dysphasia, Right sided lack of sensation and Communication with reading and writing was an issue.
Now that we knew she had survived the stroke, we wanted to know why it had happened. The doctors think a clot came from her heart and travelled to the main artery in the brain. With a barrage of testing including ultrasound, CT scans, blood tests and an angiogram it was found that Anna- Louise has a rare Autoimmune disorder called Anti-Phospho Lipid Syndrome.
The hard work of rehabilitation begins. Anna- Louise is improving daily and is now home with Speech and Language therapists, Physio and Occupational therapists visiting daily. However she is unable to return to work and tires very easily. She is smashing her rehab and we notice every time we talk with her that she is making improvements.

Tim is a loving, supportive family man and an all round good bugger. He's always been the one to look after everyone else.
Tim has the opportunity to have an extra unfunded treatment along with chemotherapy to extend his life. This is at a cost of $25,000 and ongoing at $15,000 per month. While thinking of the security of his wife and children's future he is reluctant to spend this money on himself.
The decision to do a Give a Little page is against the way Tim and Katrina have lived their lives. Although always donating to friends and complete strangers on Givealittle pages, they will struggle accepting it from others. Tim has always been the giver of time, skills, advice and for those that know him, will know his love of looking after and feeding others. I know they will find it bloody hard to accept but I also know they will be humbled and it will make a huge difference in choosing between treatment to extend Tims life giving them the opportunity to make more special memories to cherish.
We all would be so grateful if you could donate to help this beautiful family!!!

11 March 2024
It's been a bit of a turbulent time for Tim, Katrina and the family since my last update.
Unfortunately, Tim had a negative reaction to the funded chemotherapy drugs through the public system resulting in a heart attack.
After extensive testing it is now known that the funded chemotherapy tablets were the cause of Tim's heart going into spasm.
This has now changed the way his oncology specialists can work with Tim to slow down the cancer spread.
Tim will now have to decide on completing his chemotherapy treatment privately with a nonfunded drug known to have no negative effects on his heart. This will come at a huge cost but it will potentially have the same positive outcome as the original funded drug.
The option to use the nonfunded chemotherapy drug was initially thought of as a future backup plan, when and if the funded drugs failed to deliver the desired, positive outcome. They are now in a position where they have no option. And they have to move quickly as each day that goes by, the cancer continues to spread.
Your kindness has been extremely humbling for Tim, Katrina and their family and they are so very appreciative of all of those who have shown their support in any way they can. They thank you all from the bottom of our hearts.
We are only at the very beginning of this fight so, please, let's carry on helping Tim fight this. Please, if you can, donate and share. Every bit helps. Every share helps.
Thank you all!!

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

23 June 2024
I’ve had two chemotherapy rounds. 4 to go. With surgery alone I’ve only a 65% chance of this cancer not coming back with the next few years. And a high chance of it coming back into bones, brain or lung if it does. This would be terminal. So chemo gives me a bit more percentage. The chemo I need is brutal. Not gonna lie. It sucks. Nausea n 💩. Taste buds killed off by the poison. I had agonising bone pain for 4 days. Sharp stomach pain. Then at three weeks numbness and pain in feet, legs and hands. Neuropathy. They concerned about this as it can be permanent. So second round they lowered my dose by 20%. Still feeling horrible but manageable. Losing my long hair was hard at first. But I’ve wigs. Beanies. And I don’t have to wash n style it. And it’s starting to grow back already. I even went bald into pak n sav!! I don’t care anymore- I’m still me take it or leave it. This journey has shown who’s important to me and I’ve had visits from people I’ve not seen for years. So much love and care from friends. And I’m learning what matters in this world. And that is simple. It’s love.❤️

Donna has had an IV of vitamin c before starting chemo to build her immune
This still daunting and scary for Donna who has had such positive attitude and thank you all for your good wishes and prayers and thankful for your donations keep spreading the page and the love 💜
This is an upstate from Donna today
“Yesterday I had a portacath inserted under chest skin. This is to make having infusions easier. Was uncomfortable rather than sore. Sleeping on back now.
Been very anxious regarding chemo as it’s poison. But I need to kill the cancer first. Today is my first one. Have a beautiful friend with me. Trying to save my hair but realise cold calling may not work. A good friend let me borrow all her cold caps.
Steroids have made me feel good. Next few days expected to be rough - I think I’m mentally prepared”

Update message from Donna 🩷
24 April 2024
Had second surgery last night. Once the infection is all cleared and I’m healed, I start chemo for three months. Had long hair my whole life so that’s gonna be fun lol. My oncologist said his calculations showed I didn’t need chemo. I borrowed money from bank to pay for an expensive test that uses my own tumor to do gene profiling. This showed one of the tumours (I have two different types of breast cancers - one in each) is aggressive and likely to come back within five years maybe into another area which is untreatable. So although I hate the thought of chemo it is needed damn it. Edit: thank you each and everyone for your message. I love and appreciate each one of you.🩷🩷🩷

Lupus is an autoimmune disease, meaning that the good cells are attacking each other which can affect the main organs in your body. My kidneys were affected and through that, I started getting several other illnesses incl. calciphilaxes.
After much research, I found that Sodium Thiosulphate and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy are used for calciphylaxis overseas.
I was placed on the waiting list for North Shore Oxygen chamber & while waiting for my name to reach the top of the list, I did 10 sessions of oxygen therapy privately with a company called BioTrace. I found that my wound was being contained and healing. I completed another 10 sessions and found that the wound was getting smaller.
Since then, North Shore hospital has taken my name off the waiting list and rejected my Renal Specialist's request to add my name back on the waiting list. It's been three months since my last oxygen therapy and my wound is getting bigger and it will get worse because the hospital can't do anything to help me. The oxygen therapy really helped me & I will need to continue with this treatment until it heals completely.
To do this privately it cost me $1,190 for 10 sessions.
I do 3 sessions a week so that’s why I’ve started this page - coz I can’t afford the cost of treatment anymore and I still need it.
Calciphylaxis can lead to death if not treated.. BUT Im not throwing in the towel yet! Anything will be appreciated 🙏🏽❤️

Bryan Chike's Update: Grateful for Progress, Seeking Continued Support
1 May 2024
All thanks to your unwavering support, prayers, and generosity, we're happy to share that our son, Bryan Chike, is now thriving and comfortably settled at home. Your kindness has been instrumental in his journey towards health and happiness.
However, our journey towards settling the hospital bills is still far! From October to December 2023, we incurred $148,382.42 in medical bills during Bryan's stay at the NICU. And just when we thought we had gotten to the peak, another wave hit us. Between December and February, our son required further care at the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU), adding an additional $181,564.73 to our medical expenses.
While we are incredibly grateful for an insurance claim approval of $100,000 for postnatal care, it still leaves us with a daunting outstanding bill of $229,947. As my husband is an international student, and I am currently sitting at home taking care of our baby, our family income is barely enough to make ends meet, making it incredibly challenging to cover these expenses.
Your continued support and donations, no matter how small, make a world of difference for us. It's not just about the financial assistance; it's about the hope and strength it gives us to face each day with courage and determination.
Thank you for being a beacon of hope in our darkest hours.

Since our last update, we're relieved to share that Bryan has been discharged from the ICU. His journey has been nothing short of miraculous, and we're endlessly grateful for every prayer, kind word, and gesture of support that has helped him along the way.
However, as Bryan continues his recovery at home, the weight of these medical bills looms over us. We humbly ask for your continued support during this critical time. Your contributions, whether through donations, sharing our story, or offering words of encouragement, will help us alleviate the financial stress and focus on Bryan's ongoing care and recovery.

Lesa has 1 shot of IVF before desperately needing a hysterectomy that has been strongly encouraged by her doctors to be done as soon as possible for her safety, Lesa still has majority of her reproductive organs still functioning and some active follicles. There is hope for Lesa and Victor that through IVF, they would have one last opportunity in this long 10 years of trying to bring a bundle of joy into the world.

If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. We are about to close down for the peak holiday season as our holiday homes are unavailable over this time, and we will reopen for requests late January. Take care.

As many of you will know, in 2020 Miranda received the devastating news that she had terminal cancer. She’s been fighting hard for years, with constant treatment changes, most of which are not funded by the Govt. I’m hoping we can ease a bit of the financial pressure for her and Brad.
All funds raised here will be going to support her with the ongoing cost of her treatment. The treatments are called Olaparib and Enhertu.

By now, most of you will know our lovely Administrative Manager Yulinca Tome. Yulinca is the cheerful always ever so polite face of Lobell greeting you via phone and in person at our front desk.
In March this year Yulinca’s husband Seb was notified of some concerning results on his Chest X-ray scans, in April this year Seb was diagnosed with an Aggressive Primary Mediastinal Non-Hodgkins B-Cell Lymphoma cancer. The lump is located around the mediastinum (middle of chest and lungs). He is now undergoing a vigorous and aggressive course of chemotherapy for the following 18-20 weeks.
The appointments, tests, chemotherapy and recovery are all extremely overwhelming for the family, Yulinca, Seb and their three little boys.
Seb's weekly income is unknown at this stage. As such we wish to reach out for funding to support their journey for not only the unforeseen medical costs but the costs to assist with the new day-to-day routine. They have minimal immediate family here in NZ so most of this is on Yulinca.
Any donation will make a difference, we thank you in advance.

Since then he has had a further seven strokes which has left him with a lot of issues including epilepsy, chronic fatigue, confusion, memory loss, vision loss, migraines, tinnitus, extreme vertigo, balance issues, and sensitivity to over-simulation.
Brett's a great guy. One of those characters that will do anything for anyone with the only payment having to listen to his dad jokes. He was a renowned hard worker and is an amazing father, and any energy he has goes to his family first.
Brett's been unable to work and support his family over this time. Him, his wife Kylie, and their wonderful 3 kids have been under a great deal of stress and anxiety over the last years - from the initial shock of the stroke to dealing with ongoing issues and seizures.
He's been unable to work and support his family over this time, something that affects him personally as well as his family.
Kylie's been a wonderful sole earner and homemaker, but this is taking its toll too. She'd just love to see his quality of life improve.
There's a good chance she can.
Brett has been approved for a new treatment, Perispinal Etanercept, which has had great results for 1000s of sufferers. See here for details: https://www.strokebreakthrough.com/. Although the drug is approved for use in NZ, the application of it for stroke victims isn't. At this stage the only way to get this specific treatment for stroke is in the US.

Help heal Stacey's broken heart 💔 Elijah was her life.,As Stacey's family & close friends we would like to help her have another opportunity at IVF & start the process of healing her broken heart,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/701284f6-fd60-4c67-b4af-b15b01000c6f-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/help-heal-staceys-broken-heart-elijah-was-her-life,10620.0,10000.0,111 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/help-heal-staceys-broken-heart-elijah-was-her-life,23 Apr 2024,23 Oct 2024,0,International,57,"Staceys heart is broken. Elijah has passed away at 35 weeks in the womb.
After a costly, grueling and incompetent IVF experience here in NZ, which resulted in one failed pregnancy and one miscarriage at 9weeks, Stacey found a reputable IVF clinic in Greece that specialise in the tranfer of donor embryos to women who are having issues conceiving naturally. The pregnancy was a success!
Stacey carried her baby boy Elijah to 35weeks. However, Elijah started showing signs that he was in trouble at 34 weeks, and though the professionals said he was OK, a few days later he passed away in her womb. Stacey ended up giving birth naturally 3 days later. She is devastated by Elijah's passing. Her heart will forever be broken by his death. I don't think I can adequately convey the extent of Stacey's brokenness, she was so close to her dream of holding and loving her warm wriggly chubby-cheeked boy. It is every pregnant Mother's nightmare.
Her hearts desire is to try again and this is the only thing that gives her hope.
She is determined, and we admire her superwoman grit, even as she grieves the passing of her son.
Many kind hearts have asked us how can they help Stacey in this dark time. Your love, support and prayers have been greatly appreciated and overwhelming ❤️ We feel that if we all rally together, we could give her another shot at fulfilling a lifelong dream.

Our family is just blown away by the generosity and kindness that everyone has shown towards Stacey. Stacey is in shock and can not believe that in 4 short days this give-a-little has reached over it's goal of $10,000!
I can't explain how grateful Stacey is for your support. She is heartbroken, and in pieces, but she has also felt surrounded by love and support. That is making all the difference. If you are friends with Stacey, I would ask that you keep her in your thoughts and prayers, reach out to her if you can, just let her know she is cared for and that you are thinking of her. These coming months family will eventually have gone home, and it's easy to feel alone.
We are going to keep this fundraiser going as we are aware that we have only set the goal for half of the costs that this IVF journey will take. Any funds raised over our goal will be going towards paying for a private obstetrician in NZ. We believe this will give Stacey the best chance available with a high-risk pregnancy. Once again, we are so grateful for your generosity and appreciate all of your Aroha for our sister ❤️

Thank you.
My sister-in-law Kitch Grace Linazan in the Philippines who is 28 weeks pregnant is diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a condtion that results in decreased or interrupted maternal blood flow to the placenta and a lack of nutrients for the fetus. Today, 5 bottles of Intravenous immuglobulins IVIG was administered to decrease levels of anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL).
She was admitted yesterday (22 May 2024) and in less than 24hrs, their hospital bill has amounted to Php225,000. Prior to this recent hospitalization, she was admitted last 8May to 15May due to pre-eclampsia symptoms and the family is still paying for their last hospital bill of Php150,000.
At present she is still under monitoring in the hospital and the specialists advise that she give birth via C-section before end of June when the baby has a higher chance of surviving.
My sister-in-law recently lost her job and my brother’s income is not enough to support their family’s needs. With the overwhelming hospital bill, and for the upcoming C-section and Neonatal ICU costs; we humbly ask for your financial support for the family. Any amount happily given will help support mom and baby’s life.
And more than anything, please include them in your prayers. The family finds comfort in knowing there are people praying for them.
Thank you so much.

Kitch is on a 24-hr monitoring but now stable. Our baby girl was delivered at 28weeks and weighed 880g. Her physical attributes are complete. She is being treated at the Neonatal ICU at the moment to help with her breathing and lungs development.

I got sick 3 years ago. I woke in terrible rising pain. The emergency department couldn’t really manage the pain so I just lay very still for the better part of 3 months. I have been managing the effects of a connective tissue disorder for about 8 years. I was organising meetups for the local Ehlers Danlos Syndrome community and helping people find braces and competent medical help. I was well versed in pushing through pain and finding solutions where other people said there were none. But there is no pushing through this. Any exertion would put me in bad pain and terrible dizziness. I was suddenly really unsteady. It was scary. I reached out to my community - one thing described all my symptoms - vascular compression syndromes. It took me a terrible two and a half years of hard work to reach an official diagnosis.
I have severe Nutcracker Syndrome and May Thurner Syndrome.
They are rare vascular compressions, and though they are debilitating, the vascular department has told me conclusively that there are no treatment options in this country.
My health is failing steadily, it is impacting on my heart now too. And though I have no means to, I need to seek help in another country. I need to raise $140K – to pay for surgery, follow up care, travel, kai and accommodation. This surgery in Germany will treat my condition and restore my quality of life.

It was normal in the 70’s & early 80’s to go into old burning buildings with no breathing apparatus. Exposure to chemicals & asbestos fibres was extreme due to collapse & burning of the materials in the homes & buildings they worked in.
Last week Joe was diagnosed with Stage 3 Lung Cancer, caused by asbestos exposure.
While it is not curable,his Oncologist urged him to seek urgent tests & life lengthening treatment. Without it his time is significantly shorter.

Considering Dad was given short months (whatever that means) when we first were told about it. He has managed to succeed that expectation and fight it out longer than any of us thought. He has been an absolute champion through it all. Unfortunately it is very much starting to take over and Dad is starting to deteriorate . Even though he will still try to give us a smile and act like everything is ok. His eyes are starting to lose their light, hes losing the jump in his step and his mind is falling asleep. My Mum (Michelle) has had to take on this journey with my Dad on her own as my Sister and I dont live close by. Mum has had to take time off work to care for Dad. Which means finances have been super tight. With Dad needing 24/7 care now mum can no longer work. So we are asking for your help. In any way possible. If you can spare some change please donate to help ease the burden of finances and any bumps we come across on these last moments with Dad.
We love and appreciate you all. xxx

Surgery revealed its cruel reach, and now she faces the daunting road of chemo and radiation.

However, their path to parenthood has been full of unexpected challenges.
Analu's pregnancy required her to step away from her business, Koru, earlier than expected, leaving Edson to juggle additional responsibilities. In the final weeks, Analu's condition worsened, requiring Edson to focus entirely on her care, further impacting their work and increasing financial strain.
The baby arrived overdue after a long and painful labor lasting four days. Analu faced severe pain and couldn't eat or sleep. On May 13, she was admitted to the hospital, and on May 14, she required an epidural. Due to a rare condition, the anesthesia was ineffective. On May 17, she underwent a C-section, feeling every part of the procedure, which was both physically and psychologically traumatic.
Post-surgery, Baby Amelie is healthy, but Analu's recovery has been complicated by health issues such as fluid retention and blood pressure problem. She remained hospitalized for weeks and returned home on May 30.
Throughout this time, Edson has been the primary caregiver, with help from family.
However, the financial strain is big, with both personal and business expenses piling up. They urgently need support for essentials like rent and food & bills. Edson can't return to work as his focus is Analu & Amelie.
Your contribution, no matter how small, will make a world of difference.

Lovely Friends & Community,
It is beautiful to see friends, family, and clients coming together to support this wonderful family. It shows they are loved and not alone.
I went there this week to drop off some food and had a quick opportunity to see Analu and Amelie. As they are still recovering, visits are a bit limited. Your support through Givealittle has filled Analu and Edson with so much love and gratitude. Although the funds haven’t been transferred to their bank account yet as they will only receive them next month, they have received some help from Brazil, and some friends have sent direct assistance, allowing them to manage so far.
The page is still up, and we are still raising funds for them so they can get through this moment with less burden, as the bills don't stop and are piling up.
A big thanks to Symeia; when she is home on her days off, she looks after Analu and baby Amelie, so Edson can complete some of the work he has taken on. Well done, Edi, for being the mental support, husband, father, mother, and provider during this time while Analu is still recovering. But soon, she will be back to normal, recovered, and healthy.
As a client, your help and patience have been a big support. As friends and family, your help of any type has helped them feel loved and lifted during this challenging time.
To those of my friends and family who don't know Analu and Edson but still donated or shared, you are angels whom I love so much. Thank you all.

An Update on Ian’s Journey to Independence
25 June 2024
Dear Friends and Supporters,
We are immensely grateful for your generous contributions, which are playing a crucial role in Ian’s journey toward independence. Ian wishes to express his deepest appreciation for your support, your visits, and the uplifting bridge games that have renewed his zest for life. Being amongst friends has been incredibly revitalizing for him.
We’re excited to share progress on the necessary modifications to Ian’s residence. The property owner recently collaborated with a registered draughtsman to evaluate three design options for the disability ramp, ensuring compliance with the industry code. The plans are moving forward, with materials being ordered and preparations underway.
Two qualified builders have committed to constructing the 10m ramp within the next week, weather permitting. We anticipate that the ramp will be completed by early July.
While costs have escalated due to the work needed, Ian’s significant weight loss has allowed us to select a narrower wheelchair, eliminating the need to adjust doorways. This is a testament to Ian’s determination and progress in his personal health journey.
It is truly one step at a time, both in Ian's recovery and in ensuring his complete independence. We thank each and every one of you who have been a part of this transformative phase in Ian’s life. Your involvement means the world to Ian and to all of us supporting him.
Warm regards

Thank You for Your Support: An Update on Ian’s Remarkable Progress
16 June 2024
Dear Friends of Ian
We are immensely grateful for each contribution that has helped Ian on his journey toward independence. Your support will be instrumental in adapting Ian’s new home to better suit his needs, making daily activities more accessible and manageable for him.
We are excited to share some incredible updates on Ian’s progress. Recent photos illustrate his advancements in regaining mobility and strength. Ian has been diligently working on his fitness, learning to independently manoeuvre in and out of his wheelchair, manage personal care tasks, and stand on one leg. These achievements are not only steps towards independence but also a testament to his determination and resilience.
Furthermore, Ian's health improvements have been remarkable. He has successfully lost well over double his weight and is now free from the need for insulin, a testament to his impressive strength of character and commitment to his health.
Your generosity has provided Ian with the necessary resources to face and overcome these challenges and your moral support and belief in his abilities, that have uplifted his spirits and encouraged him to persevere.
Ian extends his deepest gratitude and wants you to know just how much your support has meant to him during this transformative period. He is making strides every day, fuelled by the support and kindness of all his friends.
Thank you once again for your kind and generous support.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to Ian’s fundraiser. Your generosity is making a substantial difference in his life.
Ian had his leg amputated a few months ago and with the unwavering support of hospital specialists and his own remarkable determination, he is set to leave, Hospital later this month.
A friend has generously offered Ian a ground-floor unit in Milford at a reasonable rent, which suits his needs perfectly. However, this unit requires modifications to be wheelchair-accessible. Your donations are crucial in funding these adjustments, ensuring Ian can move smoothly in his new home.
Ian is excited to regain his independence and looks forward to being back at the bridge table and actively participating in community life once again.
Lastly, let me introduce myself. I am a friend of Ian’s, having benefited greatly from his assistance in the past. A few years ago, Ian helped me extensively in my work, from building a website to advising on policy writing. Today, I am a Business Consultant at Oxygen8.

Their hope; she lives long enough for their baby Lily to have real memories of her.
It costs a lot, the treatment, treatment of side effects, life with a baby, mum with cancer and dad with a full-on job. And family at the other side of the world, Northern Ireland and England. Her story is below in her own words.
Hearing “you’ve got cancer” isn’t something you are ever prepared for.
Hearing “it’s incurable” is immediate total numbness.
Not just for me, but for my Craig and our beautiful daughter Lily.
They are my world, and I can’t help but grieve for a future that will be stolen from us.
Last April, when I was 11 weeks pregnant, I found a lump and was diagnosed with breast cancer which shifted to stage 4 after it spread to my liver and bones.
My medical team came up with a plan that included treatment for me while ensuring Lily was safe.
We welcomed Lily Lesley-Anne - named after my mum and Craig’s mum, both of whom we have lost to cancer – in September, two months early.
For a few months the drugs seemed to be working.
But last month that changed.
My last CT scan revealed my existing tumours had grown and new ones. That came with a shocking dose of reality.
Me sharing our story comes with no expectations; but we are so thankful for the offer of help.
My biggest driver is to survive long enough for Lily to remember me.
I live in hope we can achieve that.

To understand why it shifted so much, was the initial diagnosis of Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), a Parkinson’s Plus disease. This particular news hit us like a storm, ushering in an abundance of uncertainty, and a lot of heartache. We cannot thank our friends and family enough for the support during this time.
However, Budge’s current diagnosis is Parkinson’s, and the CBD remains to be a differential diagnosis in the far distance. So we are not focusing on that for now. That’s a way better space to be.
The diagnosis has forged us to celebrate small and large victories, and to draw strength from each other, which helps us to navigate this difficult journey with hope, determination, and an unbreakable bond. With that said, times like these really pushes you to consider what’s important in life, and what might help our own journey. For me, helping others, helps me, and fundraising for this great cause is one of many things I can do.
Now, as we face these challenges head-on, we are so committed to make a difference. We are fundraising to support Parkinson's New Zealand and provide hope and raise awareness for others.

March 15 2023, was an awesome day. That’s the date I donated a kidney to my daughter Anna. The operation was very successful and both Anna and I are doing well.
From this I’ve become involved with Kidney Kids, a hardworking charity that helps young Kiwis who are living with kidney disease. Sadly, this disease is incurable which makes their support so incredibly important. They assist both young individuals and their families, and advocate on their behalf.
Kidney Kids support over 400 New Zealand families, Unfortunately, demand for their services continue to grow which is why I’m asking you to support me in this appeal.
My daughter Anna has prompted me to enter the Donor Games and I’m going to compete in the 1,500-metre swim in August.
The Donor Games are based in the USA and are held virtually, with competitors submitting video recordings of their entry. The organisers told me I was the Games’ first ever international entrant.
Not only will I be flying the Kiwi flag, but I’ll also be using this event as a fundraiser for Kidney Kids. If you are able, it’d be awesome if you could help by donating.

There is no cure for this disease and while many have tried to manage it with conventional medicine, the result is almost always a slow &
severe decline in health as the organs begin to fail, and the body shuts down. This is an extremely painful process and currently, her symptoms prevent her from working. The medication she has been prescribed are a band-aid solution & as the days pass, she is more often bound to her home inflamed, exhausted & unable to eat.
Even though they say there is no cure for her we as a whanau fully hold on to hope that we will find a way .
We are currently exploring
The use of adult stem cell transplant as it has been proven to significantly improve the effects of progressive systemic sclerosis so this is an option but comes at a huge cost of approximately 50 thousand but where there is a will there is always a way. We are also researching other avenues and possibilities for Nadz.
The cost of some of her current medication is unsubsidized and the financial strain is also taking its toll on her & her whanau so anything is greatfully appreciated to help alleviate some of the barriers & stress she is currently facing.
With multiple upcoming surgeries karakia are very much appreciated
Nadz has always been the giver & it’s now time for her to be the receiver

The funds raised will go directly to Roxanne to help cover her living expenses, including rent, utilities, and groceries. Additionally, Roxanne uses a portion of her income to support her family in the Philippines.
We believe in the power of community and the strength that comes from standing together in times of need. Your donation, no matter the size, will make a significant impact on easing the financial burden our colleague and her family are facing.

Sam, a spirited five-year-old from Thames, has recently been diagnosed with Leukaemia. This diagnosis has turned her world upside down, taking her away from the joys of her first year at school and the familiar comforts of her hometown. Sam is currently undergoing intensive treatment at Starship Hospital in Auckland, where she will spend the next six weeks bravely fighting her illness.
As Sam embarks on this journey she faces not only the physical and emotional toll of leukaemia but also the disruption of her young life. Following her initial treatment at Starship, Sam will spend the next nine months out of school. Every week, she and her dedicated parents will travel to Waikato/Auckland Hospital for crucial chemotherapy sessions.
We are creating this Givealittle page to rally support for Sam and her family during this time. The financial burden of travel, medical expenses, and the additional care Sam requires is immense. Generous contributions will help alleviate some of these pressures, allowing Sam’s parents to focus on what matters most – supporting their brave girl as she fights this battle. Every donation, big or small, will make a significant difference in Sam’s journey to recovery. Thank you for standing with Sam and helping us bring hope and healing to her and her family.
Our thoughts are with Lisa McGilvray, Steve Clarke, Armanii Parata, Joe Clarke and of course Sam Clarke through this time!

As this amount isn't reflected in the Givealittle total we've reduced the goal amount to $16,260.

Revive A Smile aims to reduce oral health disparities experienced by disadvantaged & impoverished Kiwis. Revive a Smile provides much needed dental treatment, education and oral health products (such as toothpaste, tooth brush, floss and mouth wash). We treat various groups of the community including homeless persons, victims of domestic violence, refugee migrants, low income adults and the elderly. We aims to empower Kiwis to take control over their oral health by treating toothache and developing personal skills, enabling people to become active, healthy contributing members of society.
We operate our charity from mobile dental clinics and serve the north Island from Northland to the Waikato. Our mobile clinic in Hamilton was robbed recently and the thieves stole all our equipment and instruments including our AED, digital xray sensors, dental drills and handpieces, they have also damaged our dental chair and steriliser machines. This theft has forced us to close our clinic until we can repurchase and repair the damage. We are grateful to Waikato Police who are leading the investigation. Anyone with information about the theft can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

We, her buddies at Dr Morse, have got her back (pun intended!). We love her heaps, and want her healthy, pain-free and happy, so we are hoping to help Lou meet the costs of her surgery. We'd love for this to be as successful as possible, and this is how Your Support Can Help:
Your donations will directly contribute to alleviating Louises’s financial strain. With your generosity, we can ensure that they can fully focus on their recovery without the additional worry of medical debts. Every contribution, no matter the size, will make a significant difference and will be deeply appreciated.
We are also going to running a FLASH DAY EVENT some time soon so keep your eyes peeled. Dr Morse will be posting flash available on the day - stay tuned for date/time/. We are looking forward to creating awesome art and doing what we do best, to help our amazing friend in need. Thank you all for your kindness :-)
Love

HELP NEL GET GENDER AFFIRMING TOP SURGERY,I am raising money for gender affirming top surgery (Mastectomy),https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/62cb184b-9964-4e67-82e0-af4d00ff1047-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/nel-surgery-fund,3504.29,16000.0,133 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/nel-surgery-fund,14 Nov 2022,14 Nov 2024,0,Wellington,43,"Kia Ora
I started my medical transition in October 2020 via hormone therapy. Now I'm taking the next step in my transition, I'm hoping to raise some money for gender affirming surgery. Which in my case would be top surgery (removal of breasts).
I have tried on multiple different occasions to get on the public waitlist and have this surgery funded and have been denied due to capacity issues as these life changing procedures are underfunded. This has been a very frustrating process for me as this is something I have wanted and struggled with for years.
I have been told by multiple different Doctors that it's best that I go privately and try to fund this myself.
I have emailed multiple different surgeons in New Zealand and have been told that the price varies from $20k to $30k.
I feel like I have no choice but to reach out, to be as more visible as I have ever been, face reality head on, and make a change for myself. This is the most important thing I've ever had to do. I need your help and any of it means so much to me.
This is something I've wanted for a long time. I can't express how important this is for me, my overall quality of life, my mental health, and my relationship with my body.
While I am trying to save as much as I can for this surgery all money that is donated will go towards saving for surgery, and any extra costs such as support while I recover.
If you're able to donate no matter how small I want to say thank you, and sharing this around would be a massive help!
Use of funds
All money that is donated will go toward my top surgery, as well as consultations, follow up appointments, and the surgery itself.

Nel Andrews",Page Moderated,1,"Update 28/03/24 - Change of Plans ✈️ 🇹🇭🏳️‍⚧️
28 March 2024
End of 2023 I contacted surgeons again & to my surprise the price of this surgery had gone up from what was an estimate of $25-$30K, to now being $30-$35K. Hearing this news was devastating & knowing that Aotearoa’s public waitlist was no better, I felt like giving up.
However, being determined to achieve this surgery, I looked into the possibility of travelling overseas. After doing research & talking to others who have had this procedure done overseas, I’ve decided to get my top surgery done by my preferred surgeon in Thailand.
The surgery & post-op care itself is $9K NZD. This is much more achievable than it is here in Aotearoa.
To have this surgery done as well as lab tests, flights & accommodation for myself, I’ve estimated that this will cost approx $16K NZD.
I want to save as much of this total as I can, but I still need to ask for everyone’s help as this is a lot of money for me to save on my own. However, with the help & support of others I can achieve this.
Knowing now that the financial goal is now $16K NZD gives me hope that I can one day have the top surgery I need to feel comfortable in my body.
However, the urgency for this has grown more as the years have gone by & it's been taking a toll on my mental health. My goal is to save as much money as I can between now & 2026. So I can have this life changing surgery in 2026.
Funding & planning this surgery is one of my main priorities in life right now & is necessary to improve my health and wellbeing.

An avid fisherman, enjoys the outdoors with family & friends.
He & his beautiful wife just renewed their vows on the 4th Oct, celebrating their 10yr anniversary and his 30th birthday. Two days later, he became gravely ill. Suffering from excruciating stomach pain, he was rushed to hospital only to discover he has life threatening complications with multiple organs having moved from the abdomen to his chest. This is extremely rare and highly complexed. He will require multiple surgeries to place 1 organ at a time back into his abdomen so they flew him to Auckland to get the best specialists on board to help him.
He'll be in hospital for a few weeks, recovery will take months therefore his family is going to require our help PLEASE to cover living costs and household expenses.
The family sincerely thanks each & everyone for their generosity, prayers & support during this extremely difficult time.
Please continue to pray for him & his family, God Bless you all, take care.

Our youngest and only boy is named Fox Alexander Jack, He has just turned 7 years old. Fox loves being outdoors, camping, going to the beach, playing Tocko world and mine craft, jumping on the trampoline. On the 16th December 2022 our lives suddenly changed when Fox was diagnosed with Acute Lyloid Leukaemia. Shocking and unexpected news! We had to fly immediately to Starship children’s hospital, Auckland. So surreal ! That first 8 weeks were full of blood tests, needles, surgeries, Chemo treatments of different kinds, blood transfusions, antibiotics, steroids, insulin injections to counter the steroids. It is impossible to explain how hard it is to see your child being put through all of that, your heart breaks for their pain and distress! Dan’s support in all of this new hard stuff was a blessing, especially for Fox having Dad to reassure and comfort him. Like many kiwis we didn’t know anything about Leukaemia. This is a TWO AND A HALF YEARS treatment schedule and we are only 10 months in! Some stays in Auckland are for 28 days straight. Its incredibly lonely being away from our home, my husband and our daughters. We have to pay to fly our daughters up to spend time with their brother and If Dan stays to give me a break that’s income we loose. Financially this has been incredibly difficult. Dan and I are humbly asking for donations so as a family we can support and love on Fox together.

Fox is having a new product called blinatumomab. This is a targeted treatment for cancer cells. Fox is doing great and full of energy. The down side is being so far from home and for so long.

It all started around December 2018 when my world turned upside down. That's when my beloved wife, Judy, was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. The news hit us hard, but we held onto hope when the doctors found that Judy had the right mutations for a drug called Gefitinib.
Gefitinib became our lifeline. It was expensive, but thankfully it was funded by the government. For 3.5 years, Judy fought with all her might, and Gefitinib held the cancer at bay.
But then, like a cruel twist of fate, Gefitinib stopped working, that is when Judy underwent radiation treatment, and for a while, it seemed to work. But cancer, came back.
Recently, our oncologist suggested another drug, Osimertinib. It sounded promising, but it wasn't covered by government funding. The cost is astronomical. That's when we heard about Tagrix, a drug showing hope for patients like Judy this cost $1076 a month.
I can't bear to see the sadness in Judy's eyes or the feeling of hopelessness creeping in. She's my rock, and I need her by my side, especially now as I face my own health challenges. Our family needs her too.
That's why I'm reaching out, asking for help. We need to get Judy on Tagrix for at least 12 months. It's not just about buying time; it's about giving Judy the chance to keep fighting, to keep loving, and to keep living.
Thank you for reading our story, and thank you in advance for any help you can offer. Together, we can make a difference in Judy's fight against cancer.

On the 30th of November 2023 Cat underwent emergency surgery for an unexpected medical issue. This led to the discovery of Bowel Cancer.
After an initial diagnosis on December 16th of Stage 1 Bowel Cancer Cat underwent surgery in February which removed 30cm of her bowel/Colon where the cancer was. Cat had been recovering well from surgery, adjusting to life with a Stoma and Ileostomy bag and was feeling positive ahead of her hospital appointment in mid March 2024. Unfortunately the Histology results came back and Cat has now been given a diagnosis of Stage 3B Bowel Cancer. This new diagnosis meant that Cat should have done Chemo and Radiation Treatment before the surgery.
Cat was advised to see a medical oncologist privately as there is a minimum 6 - 8 week wait with 163 people ahead of her on the hospital waitlist and that she should start Chemotherapy as soon as possible to have the best outcome for her diagnosis. Through the private sector Cat is able to start Chemotherapy on Wednesdsay the 28th of March and at this stage is booked in for three rounds before hoping to get into the Public Health sector. These three rounds would come with a cost of approximately $7-10,000.
Any donation, big or small will not go unnoticed. Starting Chemotherapy through the Private Sector gives Cat a chance to beat this Cancer and be able to see her kids grow up.

She has been living with a rare disease known as Lipoedema, that was unrecognised for six years. She has recently been diagnosed with early stage 3 of the disease.
Lipoedema is a chronic progressive inflammatory fat disease, caused when inflamed tissues accumulate under the skin and progress into other areas of the body. Overtime this will attack vital organs. Lipoedema is not to be confused for lymphoedema or obesity, and is a disease that cannot be exercised or dieted away.
Danielle has restricted mobility, and suffers the physical and psychological burden of this disease on a day-to-day basis, with constant pain,swollen, heavy, and achy legs. Danielle has tried multiple public and private approaches in the New Zealand health care system, yet has been declined any help.

Sharlani has recently been diagnosed with a rare form of Cancer: Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumour. This has come as a massive shock to the family as Sharlani is a 34 year old young mother of five beautiful children, (plus another one she loves as her own) Demahrny (15) Khvalee'a (9) Rhythm-Rayne (8) and Avahrni-Rose (1) Unfortunately she lost her first born daughter Devahrnea in 2006 a few days after her birth. As you can imagine that was completely heart wrenching for Sharlani and her family. Family is of the utmost importance to Sharlani and even with this cancer diagnosis, her main concerns are her children. Sharlani lives for her babies and there wellbeing and as a mother the news is devastating!
Sharlani is the type of person that is there 100% for her family and friends and is not the type to ask for help or assistance. It is not something that comes easily to her. So with a little suggestion and gentle persuasion from family members Sharlani has allowed us to do this for her.
Almost immediately after diagnosis of Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumour, Sharlani was put on 12 hours chemotherapy planned over 16 weeks alongside immunotherapy (Keytruda). They will monitor her treatment and will alternate 4 hours one week and 12 hours the next. As you can imagine this takes it's toll on Sharlani and her children.

Rachel is fresh out of university having studied psychology, has not long started her first highly anticipated job in the field of community based mental health support, to help others which has always been a passion of hers! Hayden is her loving Fiancé whom has served our country faithfully for the last 12 years. These two wonderful humans were just starting to create a life together, marriage looming and the thought of children very closely following, until..
Rachel started experiencing debilating pain in both her knees which somedays is so bad she is forced to be bed ridden whilst others she is able to get out and about for short durations assisted by crutches. The problem? Miserable malalignment syndrome, which to put simply is a rotational deformity of the knees, which without surgical intervention will mean a lifetime of pain, immobility and complications with childbearing.
The surgical interventions required cannot be funded by ACC nor by their private medical insurance and is expected to be north of 100K, not taking into consideration the up to year long recovery from the multiple surgeries required which will also entail Rachel relearning how to walk again.
As their friend, I plead with people to help relieve them of the stress and financial burden this young couple are currently facing and allow them to see a brighter future with the possibility of creating a full family in the future.

Steph, Kane and little Riley are needing a bit of support while Riley is in Wellington hospital. Riley has been there for around three weeks now with undiagnosed ongoing medical issues. She has since gone downhill and is in ICU needing oxygen and very close monitoring. Steph has been staying there while Kane has been travelling backwards and forwards home to Masterton so he can work and still pay their mortgage and bills. Now that Riley is in ICU, it’s really important that Kane is able to stay with the girls but they need support for their mortgage payments and living costs. Please, if you are able to donate, every little bit helps. Thank you- Grace (friend of Steph and family).

Several women from NZ and Australia have had surgery with him and I have confidence in what he does
Some may know, and a lot may not know, that proper endometriosis care in NZ is lacking. Not to mention the long waitlists, if you are lucky enough to be put on one. Some have been privy to the challenging and complex journey I have had with incomplete/inadequate surgeries. I am fed up, and want the best chance at preserving my fertility, having a reduction in symptoms, and a chance at a better quality of life. Endometriosis is a complex, misunderstood, and under-researched disease. There is no cure currently. What is known, is that excision surgery with a surgeon who sub-specialises in endometriosis can really be of benefit
This has been a long, hard battle. I have knocked on every door possible to find a way forward in my situation. There is one potential private option in NZ, but very pricy. India remains the only open door currently. My research, and chatting to other women who have been to India has led me to this decision
I have some of the funds needed, but have come up a bit short. I know there are many causes to give to, and many struggling. If it is on your heart to help me out, and you have the means, I’d be so grateful
Funds will go to my sister Bridie’s bank account, and will be kept aside for me to access when I book surgery in India

In March, a young individual (Kiritea's son) was diagnosed with metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumour, a type of cancer. They are currently undergoing treatment, including chemotherapy and potential surgery.
With treatment requiring regular travel between Wellington and Christchurch, along with a recently widowed mum who is unable to work due to providing full-time care, the family is stretched thin. Basic necessities become luxuries, and the weight of simple household expenses only adds to their burden.
Navigating this journey without support is incredibly tough. While the family is helping out, financial assistance is still needed to cover expenses.
They're in a difficult place trying to keep their family together and stay financially afloat. They've struggled with the decision to ask for help, but they can't manage alone. Any support would mean the world to them, whether big or small.

Arrive in New Zealand on February 4 to work at Cloudy Bay Winery in the South Island. On May 12th I finished work and on the 18th I started traveling with my partner María Paula around the north island in a van. On the fourth day of the trip I felt a sharp pain in the pit of my stomach, so I went to the nearest hospital, which was Te Kuiti Hospital, where they referred me to Waikato Hospital in Hamilton. On May 22, I entered the emergency room until May 24, when they transferred me and admitted me to the high depend unit where I was diagnosed with severe pancreatitis. I was on oxygen since my entire abdominal area and lungs were swollen and it was difficult for me to breathe, a tube to feed and urinate, they gave me antibiotics and pain relievers throughout my stay, they did blood tests, CT scans, and MRIs to find out the state of the pancreas. I was hospitalized until June 10 and now I am still recovering with antibiotics. The insurance never helped me monetarily and the treatment I received was very expensive. I wanted to ask you for your help with what they can collaborate to be able to pay for the treatment I received and the recovery I am carrying.

If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity and unfortunately we don't have many houses in the South Island so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best.

Shane has a very aggressive type of Spindle cell sarcoma starting in his windpipe which is extremely rare. His recent stage 4 diagnosis means it has spread to other parts of his body and there is no longer the option of surgery to remove it.
In the 4 months since Shane became unwell, he has undergone numerous biopsies and scans in Nelson and Christchurch, and endless visits to hospital. This has put a massive financial and emotional strain on him and his young family. Shane's supportive partner Katie (36) and their five children aged 14, 12, 9, 7 and 4 years old are understandably devastated and overwhelmed.
The only hope they have is the Palliative Radiotherapy Shane is due to have this week which involves another trip to Christchurch, to help extend his life.
Shane is in a lot of pain and is using an oxygen machine daily as even a short walk to the kitchen leaves him struggling to breathe with low oxygen levels.
We know it's a very tough time for so many at the moment and we're not asking for support lightly. Starting this page will give Shane the peace of mind that Katie and the children will have the financial support to be there with him and have as much precious time with him as possible. It will also help with any future costs associated with his illness, which the family will face.

While Jess currently hopes to take only minimal time off from working, money from this give-a-little will allow her to focus all of the necessary energies on healing. Your generous koha here will go directly to Jess' bank account. If you are interested in providing a meal for Jess and whanau please message Mihana at 0274345843 and she will help to coordinate dietary needs and delivery.
Jess won't feel pressure to answer calls or messages if it's not a good time, so please keep the loving thoughts, prayers and messages coming; they are most welcomed and treasured. We will be updating this page regularly with updates on Jess' treatments and recovery. Nga mihi nui, Mihana - on behalf of Jess, Gene and tamariki ♡♡

On the 26th of March 2024, a few days after our whānau came together to celebrate a joyous occasion, our big young 44-year-old brother, Cory Sharland received some devastating news that rocked us all! From what he thought was a suspected herniated back disc, lead to the discovery of cancer that had returned, but this time to many different organs (lungs, colon, kidney, adrenal, liver and a small growth in the brain). It has been 22 years since his last diagnosis, so as you can imagine this has come as a big shock to him and our whānau.
Cory started chemo on the 29th of March 2024, giving him and his whānau only 3 days to prepare for their new but hopefully temporary 'normal'. Cory is married to a beautiful wahine, Catherine, and together they have two amazing daughters, Georgia and Joan.
We (Cory's siblings) felt impressed to create this page to seek financial support to assist Cory and his whānau with their journey ahead in this trying time. Our brother is not one to ask for anything, so with humility and aroha we ask on his behalf.
If you know our bro, then you know the know. He needs all the support he can get right now, and we know that through this kaupapa here, and your rau aroha (donation), some of those unnecessary pressures will subside and he'll be able to put that energy into his healing and recovery.

So we waited months for a surgery date (28th July) which involved full bladder removal, lymph nodes removed, full hestorictomy, bowel reconstruction to create a stoma for an external pouch to be attached for the collection of urine, the death rate of the surgery is 1 in 20.
The recovery so far isn't going well. New obstacles appear each day, making the battle even more draining & difficult emotionally and physically, but hopefully, she will pull through after weeks of extreme pain and suffering.
Mum lives alone with her doggo an hour away from us at the back of Huntly, she is very independent & loves her piece of paradise on the hill surrounded by her friends of the village, so therefore we need to keep her in her home for aslong as possible, but to do so we need to raise money for some repairs around her property to make it safe for her to get around as she is unstable on her feet aswell as to keep her independence aswell as to get the right care in her home and transport to future appointments

A very sad update on our mums journey
As of a week ago, we were informed mum is now terminal with very aggressive cancer.
Within that week we have noticed daily decline in her spirit.
We have been told she doesn't have long, a week even
She's in hospital at the moment as she got too weak to go spend the last if her journey at home. We're hoping she gets to hospice soon as possible to be in a peaceful environment.
So with this, the funds you all generously donated will now be going towards her final farewell to other relm.
Funds will also need to be paid to myself so we can access the money. until such time it will be held in a secure account.
Xx
Thank you to everyone one of you for your beautiful words and generosity, it has really humbled our beautiful mum, and restored her faith in humanity during her huge fight over these last months

He is braving his treatment and hospital visits in Rotorua and Auckland Starship hospital and with the help and support of his Breast Cancer Survivor and Super Warrior mum Therina, dad Neil and awesome big brother Nathan, they are doing their best to make life easier for him.

Although accommodation costs at Ronald McDonald house are covered, all funding for Matthew and his family will help support them with food, other expenses, enable Dad Neil to be of more support as sick and annual leave days run out quickly and most importantly, spoiling this little hero!
Every donation is so hugely appreciated and valued - thank you for caring! Please help get our family back on their feet by giving what you can and please share this page far and wide.

Unfortunately, this is not Chris's first battle with cancer so he was unable to get medical insurance and has to cover a lot of the costs himself. Here's Chris's story -
I’m not so good with talking about myself but here’s the story:
Late November I was diagnosed with Bone Marrow cancer after weeks of back pain.
The cancer had done a lot of damage due to being unnoticed for some time. This is normally a type of cancer that older people get and because I’m younger, my body was fighting the disease and losing without me knowing.
As there is no cure for Myeloma Cancer, I am stuck with doing chemotherapy to keep the cancer from getting worse. I will have to do a bone marrow cell transplant to stay alive until the cancer comes back and then the cycle begins all over again. I’ve been given 4-10 years with this type of cancer but being that a lot of damage has been done, I’m on the lower end of the scale.
Hardest part is dealing with the constant pain I’m in. I’ve had the Pain Assessment Team have me try some serious medication which makes me sick but it’s a trade-off against not being able to move and live comfortably. It’s a price I have to pay to live out each day and try to carry on as normal.
The biggest worry for me is leaving Emma and the kids behind with my medical bills and a mortgage. I just feel bad asking for stuff when there are more worthy people out there.

He came to New Zealand in September 2022 on visitor's visa to visit his sons and grandchildren's. During the stay he started getting sick, first he was diagnosed with water in his lungs and while being treated for that he started getting boils on his thighs and also developed Gangrene on his toe.
Due to gangrene, he was hospitalized in Middlemore Hospital many times, and the doctors kept him on antibiotics. They couldn't amputate his leg due to his weak heart. As the time went by his other internal organs started failing and due to that he passed away on 24th of November 2023.
Middlemore hospital has billed us with a total of $74,000.

On top of this I have also been made redundant from my role and to make matters worse I have applied to Work and Income and the amount I am getting alongside my Wifes income is not going to cover our bills which is forcing me to look for a part time job to cover our needs and to have a roof over our heads while having chemotherapy.

Since that time he has seen a rapid loss of muscle and function to where he is now permanently in a wheelchair and requires a hoist to move him in and out of bed. He is in constant pain and therefore is on strong painkillers to cope with that. He recently underwent crucial surgery for a stoma bag which he had to pay for privately as it was deemed elective surgery. Their reason for this was that although he is terminal, this isn't seen as critical, even though if he doesn't get this procedure done now he runs the risk of complications later, which he might not survive. I ask if you would consider donating to help cover some of the cost of this surgery which is already coming in well above what was quoted. As well he had to pay for his bathroom re-fit as local DHB stuffed up both timing and funding that he was eligible for and that is too long a story to put on here!

Since September 2023 Jess has been to hospital many times, with many debilitating symptoms. Sadly, they have only just picked up that she has a large brain tumour.
The size of the tumour is significantly impacting her health, and she needs to get the tumour removed urgently. The surgery is very expensive, and as Jess has no health insurance, we are doing everything we can to make this happen.
Jess and her family will be covering as many costs as possible, but as Jess can't work and her husband is now her full time carer (she can't be left alone due to risk of seizures, and is very unwell), any support would be gratefully received. Jess is also the step-mum of a wonderful man with Down Syndrome and other health conditions, who requires a high level of support. Before she became unwell Jess helped to share his care with other immediate family. She is a wonderful step-mum and is desperately hoping to become well again.
Jess is also an amazing step-nana to four precious little boys ranging in age from 3 to 10, who are currently all worried about the future for Nana Jess.
Until recently Jess was working in Aged Care, supporting elderly people who absolutely adored her. She can't wait to return to helping others one day, but needs our help to get there.

Thank you all so much for your kind support.
Jess had her surgery on 14 February, and is still recovering in hospital.
The tumour was even larger than expected, and although she is her usual positive and determined self, she will require a lot of support throughout her recovery.
Jess will require regular physiotherapy and other therapies, which are not government funded. If you are able to share her Givealittle page with anyone else who may wish to help on her recovery journey, that would be amazing.

An update on Jess
9 February 2024
Update: Thank you so much for the kind messages and support we have had.
Jess is thankfully booked for private surgery within the week, which is an amazing outcome. It is a very expensive option but necessary as her tumour is very large and now very serious. There are still many risks but having surgery booked is a relief. We are still waiting on the public system to even triage her, as the waitlists are horrendous. I feel for everyone working in health, it isn't easy.
If you don't have health insurance please seriously consider it. It could save you a lot of stress, and could also save your life given the current challenges. Thank you again xx

Recovery!
15 January 2024
Hey everyone, Toni here! It’s been awhile, anyways I would just like to let everyone know that I’m doing pretty well, mobility has gotten easier I’m now able to walk without my wheelchair/walker if it’s going to be short distance, if we go into the mall etc I still am finding it hard to walk around so use my walker or wheelchair depending on how my legs are, but that’s progress! Within myself I’m feeling okay, struggling with the trauma of all of this will definitely probably impact me for the rest of my life. I will get there. I just wanted to make an update to let you all know I’m doing better, slowly but surely! Thank you for your donations, love and support during this time🩷 enjoying spending every waking minute with my boy🩵

No warning was given about possible severe side effects before the Dr administered this antibiotic and yet a year later he is still in severe daily pain & unable to work.
The NZ health system & ACC have failed him miserably. He has had no rehabilitation plan from ACC since being diagnosed in Sept 2023. He is tired of suffering, and just wants to be rehabilitated so he can go back to work and have a normal life again. He is in constant pain every single day, sore hands & feet, burning skin sensations, tendonopathy and neuropathy.
After reading many medical reports from overseas cases we believe there are several treatments that can help Fraser in his recovery. Unfortunately ACC will not cover these and so we need help to fund them.
With hyperbaric therapy & stem cell therapy we believe his cells will start to heal from the damage the antibiotics caused to his mitochondria.
We know others out there who have been affected by cipro antibiotic poisoning also and want to spread the word.
If you are unable to give anything please share this to help us in this way. We are eternally grateful for any assistance we can get through this exhausting battle.

Fraser is still using the Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Chamber most days for several hours. He has noticed a definite improvement in his brain clarity and energy levels, with less bouts of severe neuropathy than before. This is awesome news as we weren’t sure at the beginning if the oxygen chamber would help as there are no medical studies on this treatment specifically for toxicity yet. Thank you again to everyone who made this possible without your help he wouldn’t have had the use of this chamber in his home every day. We are contemplating saving up to buy one in the long term as it has been so good for him. Unfortunately his daily burdon of hand and feet pain continues, but he has recently started physiotherapy through acc (finally!!)

Hyperbaric oxygen chamber in action
30 March 2024
Here is a quick vid of Fraser in the chamber, he uses it every day for 1-2 hours.
Thank you so much to all of you wonderful people who helped us get this far. He has it set up at home for twelve weeks in which we’re hoping his condition improves enough to start physical rehabilitation.
‘In a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, the air pressure is increased 2 to 3 times higher than normal air pressure. Under these conditions, your lungs can gather much more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.
This extra oxygen helps fight bacteria. It also triggers the release of substances called growth factors and stem cells, which promote healing’.

Another Dr appointment, another disappointment
5 February 2024
Fraser had a GP appointment last week which we hoped would result in referrals to specialists however again he was left deflated and disappointed. She did not refer him to any specialists or help in any way. She had no plan, no guidance, and no reassurance for Fraser. It seems that our Doctors will not do their own research and try anything to help him as nothing has been proven here in NZ (because it is a new rare case) yet we have read many overseas case studies and papers where treatments we are wanting to try have had a positive outcome. So they leave him with nothing again, sent him home in no better position to than before. So now Fraser is going to pursue hyperbaric therapy on his own accord by using these donations to try aid his recovery. As well as continuing to fight ACC for some sort of recovery plan from them. We will keep updating his progress. Thank you to everyone who has shown their support it means the world to us.

In October 2023 Nicole was diagnosed with Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos syndrome (hEDS) with abdominal vascular compressions. A genetic connective tissue disorder that affects every system in her body. She is severely affected and frighteningly this is a life-threatening condition. AVC are very rare where blood vessels, organs and nerves are compressed by other structures in the body. This limits proper flow of blood around the body and to major organs as well as food from moving through the intestines.
This leads to debilitating symptoms of constant and severe pain with nausea. Even liquid food intake is painful and she is currently fighting the suggestion of placement of a feeding tube. The healthcare system refuses to treat here. We have to look at Germany for life-saving treatment where she will undergo major abdominal surgery. Other NZers have spoken publicly about their own successful surgeries in Germany that changed their prognoses and life. This surgery is also recommended by NZ specialists.
We need your help to get her the surgery she desperately needs.

Therefore to return that love, my siblings and I created this page to help fund naturopathic treatments in conjunction with her immunotherapy and radiation.
Initially, her cancer started in the right lung but has now spread to other organs including the left lung, kidneys, hip and spine. Thankfully the cancer in her hip was surgically removed.

Our main wish is to support mum and give her the opportunity to try these treatments. Even if it gives us one more year with her.

By the time of my HSCT, I was extremely sick and disabled, unknown to my foggy mind, laying my coffin. I had tripped on the disease and plunged headfirst down Harwoods Hole, with winning odds of never surfacing.
After the HSCT, my mind quickly climbed out of the hole using my donors’ ropes, but my sluggish body was suffering from extensive neurological damage and was stuck under an overhang. I have been working hard on clambering onto the ledge for the last four years and have an idea of how far I will go without further treatment. It is not that far along the ledge if I make it, and I want to go further. Neural stem cells are currently the best available option to improve the 'Quality of my Life' and steer me towards the ‘good old days’. I hope to splash in the surf and buy something I can paddle with on my return to my much-loved ocean. In the interim, I’ll ride my peddle-assisted downhill e-trike (an exhilaration in my life).
After returning to NZ, I published a book on Amazon to tell people my story. It is called 'HSCT for MS'.
This Givealittle request is to help me on this journey with treatment and rehabilitation.

Thank you for your attention to my campaign to improve the Quality of my Life and further MS treatment knowledge for everybody.

Lets spread the word of a cure
5 May 2024
I often lay in bed thinking of people with MS that can be cured. You will read in my book, the research by three global authorities (from England, Russia and the USA), who collectively have over 80 years of experience in HSCT for MS. In 2023 (and earlier) they said HSCT is (trending) a cure. It just hasn't been around long enough to be definitive.
Partially effective disease modifying therapies for MS cost the New Zealand taxpayer on average $1,000,000 per person over their life. These can't cure the disease, and importantly, won’t improve people’s quality of life. My treatment cost $95,000 with no disease-modifying therapies required.
I am cured. Now, 7 years after having HSCT for advanced SPMS, I am starting a business designing adaptable travel scooters for people with mobility difficulties, like me. I will soon be a taxpayer, not a tax benefactor. I can’t wait.
It's more than the money. I ask you to spread the word and forward my givealittle to China campaign to your FB friends. By spreading their word, you may save a life. Enter your email address with your donation for $1 and you will receive my posts on the success of the treatment. And, every dollar is worth $3 getting me to China. So givealittle, is giveallot. Join me and spread the word of The Cure for MS.

My campaign is now underway and gaining momentum. Thank you for the donations, with a special shout-out to the Cooney family. It was about 1980 when I started 'charging' about the orchard with Eamon riding bravely on the back of my 10 geared Kawaski 100 trail bike. Janine, Emily, Seumus, and Eamon, I look forward to seeing you all in Auckland on my return from China. I won't be 'Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, or able to leap tall buildings in a single bound' but I will be closer. Your unwavering support also helped me get to Moscow in 2017.

I was living a healthy and happy life, with my wonderful family, and cherished pets. With nothing abnormal showing on any of my annual smears, the news of cancer completely blindsided me and my family.
I have since had two operations, five weeks of radiation treatment, plus weekly chemotherapy. I am fighting my best fight to overcome this with a complete lifestyle change, and embracing all the things that help to inhibit cancer.
The biggest challenge I face now is a financial one. Even with my wonderful partner’s unwavering support, I have exhausted my savings to cover the doctors’ appointments and treatments that I so desperately need to give me the best chance of beating this.
I have always been a strong and positive person who takes pride in being independent. However, the costs of beating this are so great, that I am desperately looking for the support from those that are willing to help me fight , and allow me more time to spend with my wonderful family.
I deeply thank anyone who is kind enough to consider helping me though this traumatic event – thank you so very much.
Update July 2024 As I go on threw this journey I thank everyone who has helped me.
Some days are OK so days are incredibly hard, and now my options are getting fewer , immunotherapy would be the next step but at $10,00 to 13,000 every 3 weeks seems near impossible to contemplate, praying for a miracle every day.

After spending 3 weeks in hospital, within 2 days of being home dad was told that they removed 22cms of dad’s small bowel which was riddled in cancer. Dad was diagnosed with a rare NK T cell lymphoma leukaemia and was required to undergo chemotherapy immediately! As a tight knit whānau we were absolutely devastated with the news and still to this day try and wrap our heads around the reality of this journey. After 2 different forms of chemotherapy one being the strongest form of chemo they have ever administered in Nz and another form similar not being successful then dad was put on another form of immunotherapy all within the last 8 months, with dad being admitted multiple times with fluid retention, infections and reactions from the treatment he was receiving. We have been travelling back and forth to Auckland hospital each day we have received the news that dad will be receiving his Stem cell transplant in December and dad will be in hospital through Christmas and new years. He will be given TBI( Total body radiation) and chemotherapy before his transplant. Dad is a very high risk patient and we have been given the possibilities of what could happen within this transplant that could end up fatal. We are putting all our trust into all the specialists, nurses, doctors who work tirelessly around the clock to ensure dad has the best care possible.

28 March 2024
dad has been in hospital for a very long time, Dad has been battling infections, fluid retention, graft vs host disease, rashes, loss of eye sight, we had a period of 5 weeks where dad was unable to eat anything with everything he did take in fluid wise it would either retain in his legs or he would have uncontrollable bowel motions. Dads had feeding tubes inserted, many scans done, been in and out of isolation. Many infusions and blood products going through daily, Every day with dad is very different, I have recieved multiple phonecalls within the last month from the hospital, with the doctors being very worried about dad, they meet regularly to ensure dad is on the right path. We have also been told dads CMV virus levels is high which is very worrying to the doctors which now they have put dad on an urgent course of medicine as this cmv virus can be very dangerous and or fatal. Dad’s condition is very serious but we are assured that dad is being taken care of. There is so much going on that its been very hard to keep an update going with this post being a small snipet of not only this admission and the previous, it has been by far the most mentally challenging for us all but also physically exhausting for dad. Unfortunately this morning dad has been put back in isolation with rhino virus, as tough as things are right now we know dad has the mental capacity to over come anything that has been thrown at him.

A little thing with powerful results!
WHY?
The aim is to educate and facilitate a regular habit of gratitude, through journaling in these teens.
Gratitude is more than a feeling; it’s a tool for building resilience and a positive perspective.
Gratitude research shows :
-it is the best predictor of wellbeing of any character strength
-it reduces teens likelihood of drugs and alcohol abuse
-it reduces depression and improves happiness and immunity
-it increases self control and health
The COVID-19 pandemic with its isolation and fear and social media challenges provide significant psychological challenges to many of our youth. Around 40% of children displaying symptoms of depression and anxiety during and these remain elevated post Covid lockdown . Eating disorders have increased 300% post Covid .
Help is often not easy to find or access.
This project, inspired by my passion for helping the youth of the Waikato proactively improve their mental fitness skills and my own experiences in positive psychology and practicing gratitude. Together we can address this need head-on.
The journals have been designed with the assistance of a well-known NZ leader in mental fitness, Jimi Hunt and Libby Grace.

Charlene is known to be a jolly, very optimistic and confident single woman.
Charlene recently got diagnosed with Cervical Carcinosarcoma that is highly aggressive. She recently have to give up work to start treatment. She will have her uterus and ovaries removed and is scheduled to have her surgery 31 January 2024. She will then need to recover for more than a month and start chemotherapy and radiation treatment approximately for 6months. Treatment will initially require her to go to the hospital everyday for 5weeks.
Charlene is a Filipino that lived here in New Zealand for 8years and now in Melbourne where she will have treatment and spend her recovery.
Charlene is a very family oriented kind of person. She recently lost her mom with cancer in 2020. She will give more to her family and friends than to herself. This is why, us, her friends here in NZ are hoping to be able to help her now by sharing her story and hopefully raise a fund to help her just worry about recovery.
We are hoping that we can help fund one or more of her loving sisters or brother to be with her, who are all in the Philppines as she will not be able to travel now. It will hopefully help her family to apply for visa, air fare, day to day cost, food, rent etc.
We really appreciate your help on this journey to fight this battle together!

She had had to fight hard for this, despite her ongoing health issues escalating.
Like the champ Caro is, she smashed through an accelerated Chemo plan, surgery and recovery all whilst working when she could.
This is who Caro is. An extremely hard working, smart, fiercely loyal woman who loves her job & girls.
In July 2023, Caro had follow up checks that showed more cancer, advancing even into her bones. Over the next few months and more scans, Caro learned the cancer was spreading further and fast and in February of this year found there wasn’t any more treatment for her and all there was left to do is manage her pain.
Tragically there’s nothing more to be done for her medically & sadly Caro will be remaining in palliative care with her village making the preparations for her end of life care.
It has been incredible watching this quick witted, beautiful soul having to accept and adjust to this news.
Caro has focused solely on beating this Cancer and remaining positive for those around her.
Sadly our hope for a miracle for Caro is fading, but we can still help her by helping her young daughters. She has organised as much as she can for her daughters Caitlyn & Amy's future, but we want to relieve the pressure.
Caro has reluctantly allowed me to set up this page so that we can help relieve as much pressure as we can for the girls future and ask for any donation, big or small that will assist them during this time.

30 June 2024
🕊️A few weeks ago our Caro passed away 🕊️
As much has her sassy humour, fierce love and beautiful smile was still there, knowing she is relieved of her pain gives some form of ease.
When I visited her I would read through the names and comments from the many numerous donations. Her gratitude was immense, and the relief there was extra help going straight to Caitlyn & Amy meant a lot to her. She was truly blown away.
The great Southern Girl never was one for a fuss, and it's no surprise that Caro's choice for where she wanted to rest, was to have the girls scatter her ashes down south in a few of her favourite beautiful places.
We would love to have this village give a little, whether by donation and/or simply sharing this link, to have Caitlyn & Amy go on one last memorable Road Trip with their Mumma Bear.
Any additional funds raised will continue to support the girls in this huge transition.

Lipedema fat is encapsulated with fibrotic tissue creating nodules of fat, causing easy bruising, extreme pain and the feeling of heaviness, swelling and loss of mobility worsening as the Lipedema progresses making daily activities difficult at times unachievable. Lipedema does not respond to diet & exercise like ordinary fat. There is no funding available for treatments or surgery in NZ even though as it progresses it causes loss of mobility & intense pain.
Shonalee has found this both humiliating & heartbreaking & has been embarrassed to ask for help.
After being officially diagnosed with this painful debilitating disease in 2022 & doing a lots of research, trying everything humanly possible to keep her progression to a minimum with little success - including wearing compression garments, a vibration board twice a day, medical grade compression legs pumps twice a day for hours, lymphatic drainage massage twice a week- none of which are funded. Her pain has become unbearable & is impacting all aspects of her life on a daily basis, it's starting to take a toll on her mental health. Surgery has now become a high priority as the Lipedema is progressing & quickly causing excruciating pain & some loss of mobility. Without the surgery she will lose more mobility & eventually will be unable to work.

After starting facial reconstruction, she has been told there is no funding to finish the job.
She hides inside her flat, in mental and physical pain. She keeps her twisted jaw and unaligned teeth behind four walls and waits for a turnaround from a Government agency she believes is keeping her from the prospect of a normal life.
Kremers should have had surgery by now. She should be free of the pain that drags her down. Instead, she’s still dripping water into her mouth out of a 60ml syringe. Eating is almost impossible.
We have previously raised $282,000 by generous Kiwis on Givealittle, which is sitting just waiting to pay for the surgery to reinstate Brittany's facial features via a prosthetic. This money will cover initial preparatory surgery, and the main operation, it wont be enough for long-term care.
She would need to get the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) on board.
So she submitted a treatment injury claim to ACC in May 2022 and waited.
It took ACC nine months to decline the claim.
So lets raise enough for the aftercare, which includes more smaller surgeries, dentistry, dietician, physio etc, and give this girl the life she deserves!

Unfortunately as a result of the underlying condition Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos syndrome she has developed new compressions including May Thurner and neurogenic MALS and other underlying problems.
This does not mean the Germany surgery was unsuccessful. As a result we need to get her overseas for surgery. In September we will be taking her to Spain to get these new compressions fixed.
She is down to just 39kg, can’t eat very much at all and has no energy to do anything. She is suffering from debilitating symptoms and severe malnutrition.
A former fitness instructor, she is now just a shadow of her former self. Unable to work and live a normal life. It is very expensive but we want our daughter back. Please help us get her there. Any donation would be a massive help!

When she arrived in Feb unfortunately a week after she fell and fractured her leg which led her to have surgery. After her surgery she had been mainly in bed recovering and was utilising walking frame and crutches for mobilisation. Into her 3rd month of stay one morning she had seizure and was admitted again at Middlemore hospital. After CT scan and MRI, we have been advised that she would need to have emergency neuro-surgery to remove the tumor. She was then transferred to Auckland hospital and had surgery the following day.
She spent approx 6 nights in neuro ICU and got discharged home. The biopsy result came and she had been diagnosed with glioblastoma Stage 4 wild type. Now the oncologist have suggested for radiation and chemotherapy to manage the growth of her tumor. She has told me that she wants to live and spend some good days with grandkids. Hence I have decided to go ahead and do her treatment here in New Zealand. Unfortunately it is quite expensive and we are not in the position to fully support her financially. Thus kindly seeking support and prayers for my mum so she could buy some quality time with us.

Kylie asks
Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

They are now 9, Raynor is only partially verbal & Ronan is non-verbal however both boys cannot competently communicate through speaking language leading to a constant frustration and self harming meltdowns. They have both been referred for speaking devices, however there is approximately a 2 year waitlist which means they would be 11 years old before they could get this support. However my sister does have the option to fast track this referral, at her own cost.
In addition to this, they have also been diagnosed with Pica - A compulsive eating disorder of inedible objects such as plaster, paint, dirt etc. My sister has two old sheds at their family home that have asbestos. The boys often play outside and it is extremely hard to keep them both away from picking at the walls, structure etc.

In the world of IBD there is a huge gap between what your doctor tells you, and how it actually feels to live with IBD every day of your life. It affects your career, relationships and family, your mental, emotional, and physical health. However there is so much that people can do to reduce their symptoms and improve their lives, that many don’t realise. After a decade of volunteer work for the Auckland Crohn’s and Colitis Support Group and Crohn’s and Colitis New Zealand, I want to build a website to bottle the knowledge I and others have collected from our lived experience. My hope is that it will become a valuable resource for patients, support groups, and medical professionals worldwide.

4 July 2023
Hi everyone, I have some cool news to share! Most people who know me have no clue about my lifelong fear of freestyle swimming. Since childhood, trying to do freestyle breathing has literally brought on panic attacks. As an adult I will float about in the sea or sit in a spa, but generally avoid pools and never attempt to swim. As a challenge to myself to conquer this fear, a few months ago I signed up for swimming lessons. Progress was slow and I still doubted I would ever reach my goal of becoming a confident swimmer. However with the help of an amazing coach, and after countless laps with a flutter board, today I completed my first ever 25m lap without one - it literally felt like a miracle!
Cliches often exist for a reason, and as I caught my breath looking towards the far end of the pool that I had just come from, I thought about how so recently and for so long, swimming seemed absolutely impossible to me. And yet with the right coach, a pair of goggles, and persistence, a lifelong fear of 40 years was overcome in just a few short months. If we had the courage to face our fears, what else could we overcome? If we challenged the notion of ""impossible"", what could we achieve in no time at all?

World IBD Day
2 June 2023
Hi everyone!
May 19th is World IBD Day, and for the past three years Crohn's and Colitis New Zealand have hosted an event at Parliament to advocate for the 20,000 New Zealanders living with IBD.
I'm lucky enough to volunteer on the World IBD Day Committee, and this year we chose the theme of ""Blessings from IBD"". Every illness has two sides. However we often focus on the pain and the losses, and forget to acknowledge the healing and the blessings... The communities we build, the experiences we have, the love, support and care we receive - all things that without IBD, we may have taken for granted. For example, IBD has literally taken me to Parliament! One of my biggest blessings however, is that each and every day, IBD teaches me the power of living in the present moment. (So much so that I forgot to take any photos until the event was over lol! So here's me about to leave the Great Hall after enjoying great conversations and countless canapés).
What are the blessings that IBD (or another illness) has given you?

Name & Logo
10 May 2023
Hi everyone!
Just wanted to give you a quick update over lunch while I'm perusing music themed logos as inspiration for the logo for this project. I LOVE music and got my hands on a brilliant book called ""Band ID"" by Bodhi Oser. I now have a whole new perspective on the creativity involved in designing something so small that we often take for granted!
One thing I'll never take for granted is being well enough to eat (almost) whatever I want. Just look at that delicious falafel and salad - it wasn't so long ago where a dish like that could send me straight to hospital. This is a gratitude reminder for all of our digestive tracts, without which we couldn't live.
I am also reaching the point where I get to finalise a name for this project (my baby!). Unfortunately I keep coming up with more names, not less! So I've created my first ever online survey for anyone who'd like to contribute votes or suggestions. The working title is ""IBD Hub"" but before I commit, let's see if there's a better idea out there, or if nothing beats IBD Hub after all! Please follow this link if you'd like to participate. It contains 6 questions and takes 2 minutes to complete :)
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QZ9SLQS
Again, thank you so much to all of my donors, I honestly don't know how to express what your support means to me. I get teary eyed just thinking about it! If you've donated $100 or more and would like a copy of Claire Chitham's book ""Good For You"" all about gut health and full of life changing tips and advice about how to improve your health no matter where you're starting from, please email me directly at hsmillar@yahoo.com so I can send you your copy.

Personal Hero
22 March 2023
Hi everyone, big news!!! This is completely crazy but a personal hero of mine, Claire Chitham, made a video with me!!! After a severe Crohn's diagnosis years ago, she decided to do everything she could think of to heal her gut. She wrote an amazing book to share what she learned called ""Good For You"" which is full of excellent gut health info, all of it highly relevant to those with IBD, and also for absolutely anyone looking to improve their health.
To show our passion for this work, Claire and I have teamed up for a special offer - if you live in New Zealand and donate NZ$100 or more to my project, you can get a autographed copy of her book for free (including those who have already donated!). Please message me or write in your donation comment if you'd like a book, and I'll contact you about delivery.
I'm a bit embarrassed to share this video - I was sooooooo nervous, especially sitting next to a total pro (she makes this stuff look easy!!!). But if me being awkward on camera leads to helping more people, then sign me up...

Her operation wound has developed a terrible infection (which has left a big hole in her stomach) due to lack of immunity as Kym received a kidney transplant in 2009 her body struggles to fight infections due to her anti- rejection drugs she's on for that kidney, however those drugs are now feeding her cancer cells and she might not be able to continue taking them which could possibly lead to kidney failure again.

2 March 2024
Last week Kym travelled up to Christchurch with family for her first PET scan to assess the severity of mums cancer. All went well and she left in high hopes that we had caught it early.
On Tuesday of this week Kym and the family headed off to Dunedin for a few appointments but most importantly to get her results. All high hopes of catching it early have been cut short as Kym is in stage 4 of “Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma” which is a very aggressive type that can spread in a matter of weeks and has already spread all throughout her large intestines, stomach and up towards her liver.
We were advised that treatments are needed to start ASAP but unfortunately due to her infection that is still ongoing in her surgery wound she is unable to start treatment for at least a couple more weeks or until her wound has fully healed. This has left Kym devastated as she feels she has already lost enough time.
Kyms first chemotherapy treatment will be in Dunedin which will be closely monitored to make sure mums body reacts in a positive way from the chemo due to her low immune system.
We are all continuing to keep our heads high and are very appreciative of those who continue to show love and support throughout this difficult time, we really do appreciate it.

Sadly Carol is now in Hospice Care
23 March 2024
We just wanted to keep everyone updated. Carol has been admitted into Hospice care yesterday. The advanced stage of her diagnosis has proven to be too far advanced for any chemotherapy or infusions as we had initially hoped. Sadly her advanced cancer has progressed quickly and Frank and Tamsyn are by her side all the time. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank each and every kind donation and message of support. Please keep Carol’s family in your prayers and if you’re able to share or promote this fundraiser further we ask that you do to help cover the mounting costs. 🙏🏻

Wife to Mark, Mother to Cameron and Riley. She is a supportive and caring friend, always rallying around to help others. In Oct 2021 Sheryl was given a shock diagnosis of terminal Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (LGSOC) – stage 4 (non-estrogen based) with the view of palliative care.
In Jan 2022, she started 3 rounds of Chemo, in March 2022 underwent 10 hrs of major surgery with 48 hrs in HDU in Auckland City Hospital. Sheryl now has a permanent ileostomy. After surgery, Sheryl was kept on a machine for 6 wks and was left with 4 small cancerous tumours deemed too dangerous to remove.
In Nov 2022 Sheryl was declared to be in partial remission, which she remained until May 2024. Sheryl’s cancer has now progressed with an additional tumour and a partially collapsed right lung. Options for treatment in NZ are limited due to her rare Cancer.
Sheryl is currently waiting to see if she will be accepted on a drug trial, this will not cure the cancer. If she gets on it, it may buy her some time but will eventually need to fund privately (non-funded) drugs. They are Trametinib, Verzenio and Fulvestrant. Currently we dont know what drugs she will require.
Ever the pragmatic, positive person, Sheryl continues to research her options, her tenacity amazes us all, she is an inspiration! An active member of the LGSOC and Ovarian Cancer support group, she supports others going through this terrible diagnosis, fighting the good fight, not giving up!

17 June 2024
Over the past few weeks, Sheryl has been undergoing numerous procedures, having had a chest X-ray, CT scan, blood tests, the drain for her right lung to remove cancerous fluid was aborted due to her lung being too close to her rib cage, deemed too risky of puncturing her lung. She will be having an ECG and more tests in the next week. It is hoped that future medication (either non-funded or via the trial will reduce/remove the fluid). A biopsy done on her chest cavity along with a pleural drain stung like a bee sting, and was a bit unpleasant. Sheryl ever the positive has been upbeat despite feeling like a lab rat / pin cushion, she is staying positive and being pro-active.
Sheryl has appointments scheduled at the Auckland DHB on the 19th and 26th, test results are expected to take 10 days, so we are hoping this week, some results may come through.
We also kicked off the first tick-off-the-bucket list that Sheryl has on her wish list, the Crazy Mums headed out on Sat night to the Fun Zone Escape Room The Chamber of Magic, followed by dinner at The Mediterranean Kitchen. We all survived and made it out all clues completed, broomstick and wand in hand, 15 seconds to spare! Wonderful dinner, company and laughs!
Thanks for supporting Sheryl's fight against LGSOC, please continue to share the Givealittle page, we need all the help and support we can to raise funds to pay for the non-funded medications – it takes you to make hope possible. Thank you …updates to follow.

Sheryl's Latest Update and Bear Hugs of thanks
5 June 2024
KIa ora
Firstly, a big bear hug of thanks to those of you who have donated to the cause so far, and who have shared our page – we appreciate the support so much.
Recent update: Sheryl had a meeting with her Oncologist earlier this week, and has been advised that she requires Genetic Profile Testing to be carried out for a fee of $4000 (not funded), which will be sent to Boston Texas, USA for analysis. This test will enable her Oncologist to tailor medication around the results. At the meeting, the cost of medications was discussed, and has been advised a variable figure of around $8000 to $9000 per month, with an additional administration fee of $1200, will be needed. Our target for funding medications for one year would then be $122,400 and this would enable Sheryl to receive the non-funded medication she will require going forward for a year, however, we will know more once the results from the Genetic Profile testing are back.
Please share our Givealittle Page, any donations big or small are greatly appreciated, and sharing the page helps spread the word to help Sheryl in her fight against LGSOC.
More updates will be coming soon.
I will leave you with an interesting quote from Winston Churchill… We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.
Take care everyone and thanks again, your support means so much xx Bev

We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best.

Malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in developing countries. Even when mild, it can disrupt students' education. On Likoma, it often leads to students' hospitalisation. It is easily preventable through the provision of mosquito nets. We would like to purchase and install mosquito nets for boarders at a local school, and audit hospital admissions before and after to quantify how much of a difference your donations have made!
================================================
Period poverty is a huge issue in Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world. We, Ben and Romy, hope to provide two year groups of high school students with reusable period products on Likoma Island (a small island on Lake Malawi - population of around 10,000). But we need your help!
We will be travelling together in August to Malawi - in Southeastern Africa - with Medic to Medic, a small UK registered charity. Ben will complete his medical elective while Romy helps with the running of the charity. We will be spending time in Blantyre and on Likoma.
Our period poverty project on Likoma will require $2000 of raised funds before we leave. If our mission resonates with you, we are grateful for any contribution, no matter how small. :)
Romy is a final year Global Studies/LLB(Hons) student and Ben is a final year medical student, both at the University of Auckland.

On Friday 28th July My brother Erueti Remuera was airlifted to the Perth Royal Hospital Intensive Care Unit and is fighting for his life after being struck to the head with a pole, fracturing his skull and causing bleeding and swelling to the brain.
The doctors have got him in an induced coma and are hoping that this gives him a fighting chance to heal before they decide the next course of action.
Obviously now that Ed is not working our family have started this page to help cover some of the medical costs involved, and also to help Ed and his partner to cover any living costs they may have now that neither of them are able to work during this difficult time.
Unfortunately nearly a week later there has been no improvement to Eds condition and he remains critical in ICU so any support big or small would be much appreciated as we currently have no idea how long he may be in a coma for & unable to work....
Once again our whanau would like to thank everyone for all the kind messages we have received and for keeping Ed in your thoughts and prayers.

Ed has definitely seen better days and he has a long road of recovery ahead of him.

She's 35, a single mum of three awesome kids, and my only sister
This year, Krista was diagnosed with cancer. In August, she went to Hutt Hospital to have a salivary gland secretory carcinoma removed. This involved removing half her lower lip, and removal of lymph nodes under her jaw. This required a neck dissection, which has left her with limited mobility in her right arm due to the severing of the nerves. An independent person, Krista now needs assistance with basic tasks
After surgery, Krista was discharged home to Palmerston North. Within 24hrs, however, she developed a severe post-op infection, and was taken to hospital via ambulance. She was transferred back to Hutt Hospital, and spent another week recovering from infection
Krista requires further surgeries to reshape her mouth, along with physical therapy, and will undergo targeted radiation. This means a lot of time off work, travel to Lower Hutt, and nights down there for her and our Mum, who is Krista's main support person. It also means being away from her kids, who are missing their mum terribly

8 September 2023
As if having cancer and her face sliced open wasn't enough for Krista and our family to deal with, this past week she has been a patient of the Women's Surgical Unit, getting some help for yet another complication!
Thankfully being in Palmy hospital means we can take the kids up to visit, but morale is down a wee bit for them all. After being so thrilled to have Krista back home again, this setback has been quite disheartening, and everyone is missing each other.
In some slightly more positive news: Krista has been working on her shoulder physio, and has regained some of her range of motion! There is still pain if she lifts a bit too high or moves it too quickly, but she was thrilled to show off her ""new trick"" when I brought her up some fresh PJs this morning.
We want to thank everyone for their generous donations and continued support/well wishes, we have been blown away by the first big wave of contributions!!
We do still have months and months of medical and hospital visits and their related costs ahead of us, and while UCOL has some wonderful supports in place for their staff in situations like these, Krista will very soon be out of her extra sick leave.

So our loved Sonya has been diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer which has spread to her lungs and her liver. Unfortunately Sonya has been told that it is incurable. But we are all very hopeful that she can make it through this. Sonya underwent a surgery but unfortunately due to oxygen levels they had to stop. She is now undergoing chemotherapy but the medication costs are through the roof. They’re charging $4000 for Avastin or Erbitux meds which are meant to help. Sonya is now on medical CBD oil which costs $115 a fortnight (a prescription has been cited by the givealittle tem). So I am here asking anyone who is able to donate to help this family. Anyone who knows the Minto family knows that they are a giving family with so much love. Help me, help them and give them a little bit of relief. Even if it is $5. Any donation is going to help.

Anything is appreciated 🙏

Since then it has been a hell of a roller coaster, emotionally, mentally, and financially, the family need some more support
They have had a super rough year with all the travel back and forth to Aucklands starship and palmerston north hospital, jobs being put on hold and other kids to care for. Aria’s mum Ngaire has had to finish up work to care for her. Still a long way to go with treatment as is a 2 and half year plan which continues on till dec 2024. Having had long month stays in Auckland has had a huge impact on the family income and being separated. Aria is finally on an up after a long stay in hospital and an 8 week stunt with chest infection, kidney issues and not being able to keep anything down. But still many more visits to starship to undergo.

During her second surgery they found that the Cancer has also spread to her Lymph Nodes, which is not the news that anyone wants to hear. She is a young mother of 2 beautiful children, Dallas aged 8 and Evie aged just 3 years old. The children's Father is working in full time employment while trying to be there to support his family and balance the heaviness of Amanda's diagnosis.
Amanda has already had to take out 2 financial loans to get prompt specialist care. The financial toll this is taking on there family adds extra stress during the hardest time of their lives.
We are trying to raise funds to help ease some of the extra added financial pressure this has had on Amanda and her family. While her chemotherapy is funded, as she has decided to go private there are additional post chemo costs which unfortunately are not funded such as Private specialist appointments, surgery, hospital etc, which means the family need to fight to find the funds to help Amanda fight Breast Cancer.
As you can imagine this is a scary diagnosis for a mother who wants to be there to watch her children grow up and reach all of life's Milestones beside them.
Every dollar counts.
Every Prayer counts.
Please help this beautiful family in there time of need. Amanda is such a selfless, kind hearted woman who would stand beside you in your time of need without hesitation. Lets stand beside her and support her throughout her fight. Her children deserve to grow up with there mum beside them every step of the way.

Our family moved to New Zealand in September of 2023 to find better opportunities for our small family.
Life took an unexpected turn for our youngest son Von.
Von is a spirited 4-year old, who was diagnosed with B-Cell Acute Lymhoblastic Leukemia. This has brought a whirlwind of emotions and challenges to our family, and we are now navigating the tumultuous path of his treatment and care, ( chemotherapy, prolonged hospital stays and surgeries that will last for two years (2024-2026). The cost of his medical treatment is covered by the hospital.
My husband and I are on a work visa. I work as a caregiver while my husband is a carpenter. We are living in a shared accommodation in Tawa due to financial constraints. This can be particularly challenging and potentially harmful for Von who has weakened immune system. There is a lack of privacy and makes it difficult for us to manage Von’s physical needs.
I must stop working for me to be there for Von’s treatment. This has further strained the family’s finances and is becoming increasingly difficult to manage, causing significant stress and anxiety for our family.
We are raising funds will allow our family to get through the long journey ahead without financial burden.
Every donation, no matter how small, will make a significant difference in Von’s journey towards his recovery and help us overcome this challenge that my family have ever faced.

Indy has struggled with mild motor delay, auditory processing disorder, and single-sided hearing loss that went undetected by the medical system since birth.
With a lot of push, struggle, and strife, we fought through the system to try to access the help she requires, but we faced only failure. It was with the independent help of the Tauranga Developmental Learning Centre in 2021 that we were able to fully detect her hearing loss and provide Indy with a detailed support plan. To ensure the success of this therapy, Indy must have cochlear hearing implant surgery.
Indy was placed on the Starship surgical waitlist for her cochlear implant at age 9 (in 2021). The wait for this has been a burden on her, and she was only recently called to have this surgery at age 12 due to Starship ENT wait times. To our relief, she successfully had this surgery last week.
Now that Indy finally has her hearing corrected, she has a lot to catch up on neurologically and requires the Developmental Learning Centre’s support for this. The therapy centre comes at a high cost and will be intensive for the next 18-24 months. Any support, big or small, will be truly appreciated to help her on her way to living a healthy and content life.

Cystic Fibrosis is an invisible condition. The physical impacts are not always obvious which can make it difficult for others to fully understand the daily struggles and limitations that individuals with CF experience.
Cystic Fibrosis is a progressive, lifelong and life shortening genetic condition that has no cure. It causes the body to produce a thick, sticky mucus that builds up and damages the lungs, digestive system, liver, and other parts of the body.

This is something that I am not proud of, but I have to live with. My story isn’t unique, it is a story of many before me and sadly it will be the story of many after me.
What is different about my story though, is what I do today and how far I have come since completing Red Door Recovery 2.5 years ago. This programme, the structure and the staff saved my life and broke the cycle to save generational trauma in my whanau.
I lost everything in my old life, I lost my freedom, my daughter and my mana. But today I have all that back, and I owe it all to Red Door Recovery.
I stayed on to volunteer, and now worked my way up to work as Intake Manager, and this is why I write this letter to you today. We aren’t eligible for government funding as we don’t “fit” the criteria. The amount of heart breaking phone calls I get from loved ones seeing their family members fall to addiction is staggering.
Why I am writing to you is to ask for help and support, any type of donation to sponsor someone who can’t afford our programme and give them the opportunity to change their life, to change their families life and to break the cycle of addiction. As a collective I believe we can make this happen and what I offer you in return is a 100% commitment that Red Door Recovery will give every bit of support on their journey for them to completely transform their life.

She is loving the freedom and enjoying life in this lovely country. She has lots of hopes and dreams for the future which we know she will be able to achieve in New Zealand.
Unfortunately during Covid times her health has deteriorated due to the stress of lock downs and awaiting her residency to be granted. In 2022 she had to undergo two emergency eye operations which left her blind for almost two months. As her family where not residents (and therefore don't qualify for any government medical funding) they have had to pay for all treatments personally. Her family are still paying these bills off. Thank fully she has regained sight in her one eye.
A couple of months ago she was diagnosed with Stage 5 kidney disease, suspected to be caused by her diabetes. Her renal doctor has been supporting and looking after her and they have been kind enough to charge the family a special rate as the family are appealing immigration to try obtain residency for her. This weekend Raquel has had a drastic turn in events and her life is in danger if she does not receive dialysis urgently.
As she is not a resident she doesn't qualify for any government funding treatment. Her family are working lots of hours to try cover the bills.

The only way to treat this is to put a shunt into her brain to drains the excess fluid into her abdomen. Alissa had many complications but she is a little warrior princess who has beaten the odds over and over. She has her first shunt was done at 3 weeks old, and has had many shunt revisions after blockages, shunt failures & other reasons. Mid-Feb our little girl went home for the first time, and a week later she was back in hospital with a respiratory infection & fungal meningitis, She ended up on life support a month later after contracting a bowel infection. On 1st April, life support was withdrawn and we thought she was not going to survive, but she is a fighter with other ideas! On 20th May she got to go home again, and after another shunt revision in June, that she started to thrive at home with her parents. In August 2023 we made a trip over to meet our little princess - what an amazing little girl she is. In January this year, she was admitted to hospital with pneumonia and she suffered two cardiac arrests. Her shunt has now been removed again and we watch and wait and pray.

Update on Alissa
27 March 2024
Yesterday Alissa was taken back into surgery as she kept getting temperature spikes of up to 40 degrees. They found a cystic lesion at the bottom of her brain which they have now broken, washes and cleaned. Hopefully this is end of her infection and temperature spikes. To date she has now had 15 surgeries in her two and a half years. A new shunt will be done next week if everything goes ok and then she has another 5 days in hospital after that before she can go home again.
Thank you all for your generous donations, your love and prayers - this little girl is God's warrior princess and He has his angels watching over her!

While we have been traveling, my partner Paris has grown quite the mop on his head / face & so we thought why not do some good with it and shave it all off to raise some money for our Abbie girl & her husband Karl as he is no longer working so he can support Abbie & spend this time with her.
If you are in the position to, please donate here. The money will go toward whatever they wish to spend it on, so they can enjoy this precious life together while they can.

Kylie asks
Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

In addition to the total destruction of our sweet home and our storage.
We used to have simple life, a beautiful home that we have been working for years to build and decorate. We even had our own business, I had a plumbing tools shop. However, i lost it all, and lost my savings. Our home was destroyed to the ground and my shop with all the goods was burned. It is not only about losing everything that we had, it is also about not having any current income.
My children were exposed to many psychologically painful scenes. They witnessed the martyrdom of their neighbours, their friends, and their grandfather in front of their eyes, which led to them going into shock and post traumatic stress disorder . My wife’s psychological condition is very bad. Her father died in front of her eyes because he needed to renal dialysis and was unable to do it due to her inability to go to the hospital for fear of bombing, in addition, she is pregnant and cannot take care of her health and food.

I was given steroid creams as a child to treat eczema, however this only lead to using more and more steroids and stronger ones. Eventually the steroids stop working and the only solution is to stop all steroids which then creates an horrific process called TSW (Topical Steriod Withdrawal). For more information please head to www.itsan.org
After 7 months of being bed-ridden, sleepless night, burning and itching everyday, hair loss and depression, I could no longer continue TSW. So after going back on steroids after the 7 months of withdrawal, I have spent the last couple of years struggling through life using steroid creams again, but suffering from itchy, burning skin daily.
Recently I came across some other TSW sufferers who had travelled to Thailand for a treatment called CAP TSW Therapy, which is a Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) treatment. The results are amazing and already many who have suffered from TSW for years have now got their life back and their skin has returned to it's original healthy state before the use of Steroids. This has given me much hope after a lifetime of pain and suffering and I believe this will be the key in getting my life back. So I am now in Steroid Withdrawal again and I am booked in for treatment in December 2023 in Thailand.
The funds will be used for the treatment, travel, accommodation and general expenses.

It has been wonderful to have my Mum here with me in Thailand, she is so supportive and comes with me each week to the clinic, where she spends time talking to the other patients in the waiting room while I am getting my treatment. She is such a treasure and we have a lot of fun together. Unfortunately she has had a lot of pain in her shoulder from a past injury, and we have had to visit a hospital in Bangkok to see a doctor for pain medication and also a steroid injection which she will get today (Friday). The hospital is a private international hospital and it is fabulous. The staff speak English and they are so efficient and affordable, so we thank God for this great service here.

UPDATE ON KAREN'S SKIN THAILAND January 2024
26 January 2024
Hi All, Just wanted to say a big 'THANK YOU' once again for your wonderful donations that made it possible for me to be here. I have now had 9 treatments and have 3 more to go. My skin is feeling stronger and thicker and I no longer react the same to irritants or things which I did in the past.
Over the last week, I have been able to stop taking sleeping pills and only take a sleepy antihistamine which is working well and I am managing to get some decent sleeps! Thank you Lord!
It has been wonderful to have my Mum here with me in Thailand, she is so supportive and comes with me each week to the clinic, where she spends time talking to the other patients in the waiting room while I am getting my treatment.
On 21st February we will be leaving Thailand and travelling to Uganda, where we will visit Bible Schools, Orphans and Widows in Kenya and Uganda. We will then return home to NZ on 17th March. We are so excited about visiting our friends in Africa and so thankful for the Rangiora Baptist Church and others that helped sponsor our travel to Africa.
Please pray that my skin will remain healthy and strong as we travel in Africa, as it will be such a different environment than here in Thailand.
Bless you all, thank you so so much for your prayers and donations. Love Karen

LIFE IN THAILAND!
1 December 2023
Hi to all your wonderful people who have made it possible for me to be in Thailand right now, to receive CAP (Cold Atmospheric Treatment) for my skin. I am up to my second treatment (they are once a week) and things are going well. It has been amazing meeting all the other TSW patients here that I have corresponded with while in NZ. The treatment lasts about one hour and is so relaxing. The skin becomes quite sensitive for the couple of days after treatment, so I spend most of those days in my apartment to avoid irritants. It is so wonderful to have Mum with me, and we have been able to find everything at the shops that I need, to continue my very strict diet, which is good. Jay, the owner of the clinic, is amazing and has a wealth of knowledge regarding TSW as he has treated patients for many years now and understands a lot. So along with the actual treatment, we receive much education on how to look after our skin and avoid irritants that cause flare ups.
Thailand is a lovely place to live, people are friendly and things are very inexpensive to buy. We travel to places via taxi which are incredibly cheap here to use and comfortable as they are air-conditioned. We discovered a beautiful cafe yesterday after treatment and spent a great time talking with Kyle, a patient at the clinic who spends a lot of his time helping other patients. A real Star! Thank you once again everyone for your generous donation! Love Karen

One Month into TSW & No Moisture
16 September 2023
Hi All, I am so very grateful to all that have given so generously towards my cause - a big THANK YOU to you all! It will be one month into TSW (Topical Steroid Withdrawal) & Moisture Withdrawal tomorrow (17th Sept) which is great. My face seems to be doing okay, but my legs and arms are in a lot of pain. It is very difficult to walk and there is swelling and huge amounts of flaking skin. This is all good signs of healing but super uncomfortable. Still managing okay though, knowing the end is in sight when I get treatment from Thailand! Thanks again to everyone who has given!

Saras went to the Urgent Care with fatigue and pale skin. Blood test was ordered and due to abnormal result was asked to go immediately to Emergency Department at Middlemore Hospital. She had multiple blood transfusions. After doing all required test specialist gave a shocking news to the family that she has been diagnosed with Cancer of Bone morrow(Acute Promyelocytic leukaemia) also known as Blood Cancer. He also added that it is highly treatable and treatment cost is very expensive. Due to her Visa status Auckland Regional Hospital refused to treat her and was recommended by the specialist to take her to India to save her life or else she won’t be able to make it. She had to leave urgently for her treatment with her husband as a support person to India with the help of families and friends who contributed for her flight fares. Treatment cost is very expensive and it’s unaffordable as both of them are not working and husband just underwent open heart surgery 7 months ago. It is very challenging journey for the family to support her financially. Donating a dollar will make difference to her life.

At 2 AM on April 25th (Anzac Day), Bailey was informed that his pregnant partner, Jolie, had been rushed to the hospital with severe stomach pains. Jolie unexpectedly went into early labor, and their son was born prematurely at just 24 weeks. Immediately after birth, their son was taken to the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) for stabilisation before being transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in Wellington for specialised care.
Upon arrival at the Wellington NICU, their son required continuous monitoring. Routine brain scans disclosed multiple brain bleeds, with one bleed raising concerns about a possible grade 4 severity—where bleeding extends into the brain tissues around the ventricles, potentially leading to significant long-term neurological impacts. The medical team has indicated that further scans will be necessary to assess his condition.
After discussions with the doctors, Bailey and Jolie were informed that, if all progresses well, their son would need to remain in NICU for at least ten weeks. In light of these events, this Givealittle page has been started to help alleviate the financial strain on Bailey and Jolie, enabling them to stay by their son’s side during this critical period.
Updates on progress will be provided as they become available.

Johnny was in a surfing accident at his fav Gold Coast surf break D Bar. On his first wave of the day he hit a sand bank and broke his back, bent his spinal cord, broke a few ribs and had a slightly collapsed lung. He was held above the surface and helped into shore by a group of surfers and lifeguards.
He was then treated by a team of paramedics, and airlifted by Westpac rescue helicopter to Brisbane to have surgery, which went as well as it could. Whilst currently paralysed from the hips down, we are staying positive for a full recovery, everyday bringing something new to hold on to!
Charlie and Johnny are two of the most kind and selfless people I know and have supported me in so may ways and never expected nor asked for anything in return.
In order to help them on the road to recovery, some my flatmates, friends and I have signed up to run the Dunedin half marathon on the 15th of September to fundraise for Johnny and Charlie and the next stage of their life and the road they have ahead of them.
It is always hard to ask and accept help, though with a very uncertain future ahead of them I would love to ask for your help to fundraise to support my sister and her incredible fiancé in what will be one of the hardest challenges they will face and very uncertain time ahead. Anything and everything is so appreciated.

29 Years Young a Mum diagnosed with stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer,"Any donations you can make, will be life changing for Jordan and her young family to help her make a lifetime of memories.",https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/d69ba48a-07c7-4672-9b5d-b04701415689-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/29-years-mum-diagnosed-stage-4-breast-cancer,2210.0,0.0,21 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/29-years-mum-diagnosed-stage-4-breast-cancer,25 Jul 2023,25 Jul 2024,1,"Rangiora, Canterbury",27,"A month before Christmas Jordan’s horse knocked her in her breast, to the point it winded
her and she nearly fell over. A week and a half later Jordan’s breast appeared to go hard on
one half. She went to the doctors after a horse show, as it was now a noticeable lump.
Being 29 years old and thinking absolutely nothing of it.
A week after Christmas Jordan was diagnosed with stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer. Which had spread to her T8 in her spine, this needed urgent stabilising before she was left paralysed.
She was given Cementoplasty and 2 Radiation treatments however Jordan is still experiencing back pain which has left her wearing a back brace and needing a wheelchair on bad days.
She was given urgent Chemotherapy appointments due to earlier cancellations as the breast lump was growing rapidly. She started Chemo in February 2023, which Jordan has
now finished 3 months of the strongest Chemo available and is currently having weekly
Chemotherapy treatment for another 3 months, hopefully she will respond well enough to this
treatment to have radiation followed by potentially surgery.
Our family believes Jordan’s unicorn horse knew something was not right and with the one
disrespectful nudge, he was telling her to get checked out. The timeline of events is too much of a coincidence otherwise. Jordan is grateful he did nudge her otherwise it could have been too late for any treatment as Jordan had no other signs of breast cancer and felt well.

After many tests he was diagnosed with Panicillas T-Cell Lymphoa Level 4 Cancer. As treatment time came, Cole and his whanau endured many obstacles, sleepless nights & days of uncertainty. Cole was determined to fight this as the doctors words were “He had a CHANCE.”
In December 2021, Cole and his whanau received the news that he been put into remission. Tears of joy flowed, Cole, his whanau slowly adapted to there new way of living. They took this CHANCE & got back to the new normal for all of them. Cole began work on the Covid Call line, then finally had the strength to return to work at Carters.
In 2022 the cancer had returned, Cole & his whanau were faced with this fight again. This time around it is more severe, spreading rapidly. They are devastated! They found a donor and treatment is about to begin for Cole, his wife Kim, there children as well as there extended whanau.
Those who know this family, know they will take the shirt of their backs to give, even if it was the only one they had. This has taken a toll on this family emotionally and financially as Cole had to finish work, & his wife had to be put on casual. This allows her to nurse him, talk with him and be his rock.
We are asking if anyone would love to donate, koha to this ataahua whanau to help with day to day living while in treatment. We appreciate you for even taking the time to read this page.

In the last week the Guest family noticed Zack's health significantly decline.
They were hit with the very hard, unexpected and emotional news that Zack has Leukaemia.
Zack began having regular nose bleeds, flu-like symptoms, coughing, regular high fevers, pale, low energy and a loss of appetite. Kim noticed petechiae spots over Zack's body and bruising became more evident. These signs are extremely symptomatic of this type of cancer.
After a long week of their precious Zack being sick and in and out of the doctor’s rooms, they were finally referred to the hospital with multiple blood tests, x-rays and medication. They thought Zack just had an upper respiratory infection and hoped that they would be able to go home but it turned out that it was just the opposite.
It is going to be a long road ahead but we trust and believe that he is going to pull through this. He is going to live a full, healthy and prosperous life because that is what God has set out for him. He is the God of the impossible.
This funding is to support the Guest family with their daily expenses while they are both unable to work.
This Givealittle page provides an opportunity for people to donate and follow along with Zack's journey and we would love to get as many on board as we can.

Her son, Elias, was born with a rare birth defect called posterior urethral valves which occurs in just 1 in 8000 boys.
This is where valves in the urethra stop urine coming out and it travels back up into the kidneys.
Elias underwent surgery at 4 weeks old to resolve the issue that caused all the damage to his kidneys but this hasn’t fixed the damage already caused to them.
Unfortunately after surgery Elias had a complication where he couldn’t urinate for 24 hours and this has put him into kidney failure.
While the neonatal team have done all they can to help their baby for the past month and a half, they’re moving over to the paediatric ward where Elias will be learnt about and cared for and begin his next journey before starting dialysis in starship hospital in just a few months.
Elias is the youngest of 6 kids who are all desperately waiting for their brother to come home due to covid they have only spent 30 minutes with him.

As some of you may know, Jude’s health hasn’t been the best lately and her kidneys are nearing end stage renal failure. They are currently at 8% so after her specialist appointment, she had surgery and got her fistula which is the first step towards haemodialysis. She is starting dialysis next week and I thought this is a way to help with all those costs that are sure to pop up throughout this journey.
Not only is she dealing with kidney faliure, she has other issues that may require surgery in the near future as well as other medication which isn’t yet funded by the government. As her family, we would like to ease the financial burden that she is about to take on.
We don't expect everyone to donate, this just gives you the option to do so. Just like we don't expect everyone to get tested to see if your a possible match for kidney donation. However, if you are interested, we have forms for getting tested to see if your a possible match.
She has always given and supported many people through out her life and she's humble and rarely accepts or asks for help. She is the most amazing big sister and a better aunty to every child she's ever met. She's kind, caring, considerate, strong and extremely supportive of us all.
We love her so much we want to do anything we can to help.

Early April, this was diagnosed as Hodgkins lymphoma.
While this generally has good survival outcomes, anxiety is a significant barrier to the progress of treatment at this stage.
Chanelle has had to cancel public speaking engagements and hasn't managed to work much since they got their diagnosis due to severe anxiety, depression, and having low levels of energy. This has been upsetting as they love the work they do.
They have a long journey ahead of them even if they get through all of the chemo treatments.
Chanelle has helped thousands of people all over the world with their books 'I am autistic' and 'This is ADHD', aswell as the work they have done in advocating for the neurodivergent community.
A few people have asked if they can send gifts or koha in support, so we have set this up as one way for to do this, and to show Chanelle they are not alone, in the same way they have done for this community.
Please do not feel pressured to donate, this is just here for anyone who wants to support in some way but may not know how. This will also go towards buying rewards like lego or things Chanelle likes that make them feel a little bit better but unfortunately come with a bit of a price tag.
You can also support buy purchasing either of their books from almost any bookstore ('I am autistic' and 'This is ADHD'), or leaving a supportive message on their social media (instagram linked)

Kia Ora all, as some of you may know Chanelle recently had a scan done to see if the Chemo is working. Chanelle has since received the results which were overwhelmingly positive! The tumour has shrunken significantly, and Chanelle is responding well to chemo. Treatment will still be continuing as planned in hopes that it is curative. We continue to appreciate all of the support in the various capacities ( such as donations and messages) , it really does make things a little bit more manageable!
Thank you!

Kia ora,
First of all we want to say a huge thank you to everyone for your generosity and kind words. It is so very appreciated.
Chanelle is currently a quarter of the way through their treatment, it has been difficult to say the least. Chanelle has been finding it really hard to focus on anything else, including work. These donations are really making a huge difference to Chanelle in taking away some of the financial stress of this nightmare. Chanelle is set to go through their next treatment tomorrow, however they have really been struggling with this so please keep them in your thoughts.

In 2017 she came to nz for second opinion where we saw a specialist in ascot hospital Greenlane and after the investigation with MRI and CT SCANS PAT SCANS the specialist confirmed us that it was recurrence of cancer stage 4 now. she was prescribed harmonal tablets and her cancer was at a low side she didn’t had a pain for a while. The pain started again 1 month ago where we have discovered again that she has recurred cancer again and the harmonal tablets she was on are not working for her anymore.the oncologist from ascot hospital has advised us that she would need a radiation this time as the cancer is spreading all over her stomach.
Since she is not permanent resident of New Zealand so we have the pay for all the cost that will occur.

As most people are aware, I'm currently saving up for top surgery. I was originally going to go private in Wellington, as it's not funded by the public healthcare system here, though I realised I just couldn’t wait that long to save up for it (32k). So, I’ve decided I’ll be going to Thailand for the procedure instead, which is half what I’d pay in NZ (around 15k including flights and accomodation).
It's hard to put into words how important this surgery is to me. It will be life changing. The dysphoria I get surrounding my chest is exhausting at times. I can't bind anymore as I started to develop pain from it and I worry about long lasting effects. The thought of being more comfortable in my body is so, so, SO exciting.
I've been openly on this journey with my transition for two and a half years now and it's the happiest I've been in myself since I can remember. Getting this surgery will just be another step in the right direction.
Looking at the amount this is going to cost is pretty overwhelming, so I'm reaching out to my community in the hopes that I can find some support. When I say every cent counts, I really mean it.
I have a website where I sell my art and all sales on there will go towards my top surgery too!

Change in plans!
18 February 2024
Kia ora all! After a lot of consideration, I’ve decided I’ll be getting surgery in Thailand instead of Aotearoa. As much as I didn’t want to travel for the surgery, it feels like my only option as it’s just so much cheaper — saving up over 30k just didn’t feel attainable in the next couple years. I need this surgery and Thailand seems like my best bet on having it sometime soon. Nothing has changed in terms of my fundraising, other than the goal being a lot less now! Thank you for everyone’s continued support, it means so much to me xx

I am an Australian woman who moved to NZ 1 year ago and have been in search to help heal my chronic pain in my uterus (endometriosis) for years. I have been living at an ashram in Golden Bay for almost 1 year in hopes that i would get better, in this time i have completely ran out of all my money.
The chronic pain i am experiencing is getting so severe with extreme chronic fatigue included, i can barely function and I really need specialists to help heal this. Potentially a flight ticket back to Australia to get extra government support. I have been feeling so helpless and lost on what to do, so i am creating this crowd funding as a possible solution to help me move forward and start getting the treatments i need. Although i cant ask for money without offering something in return.
I'll have a recording of me guiding a yoga nidra practice (donation of $25) Also i will offer a video of me teaching a restorative yoga practice ($35) very soon once ive completed my course as a fully qualified teacher.
PLUS I am also SUPER passionate about dance and will share a video of me dancing (like a FUNky silly sausage) ($50) to help inspire joyful movement and you can dance along side me in the comfort of your own home! All 3 for $108. Leave your email address in the comments or email me at gem.mcgowan@outlook.com for my return offerings. Thankyou so much for reading. Love & blessings x

Treatment update - Aims finished her last round of Chemo (and immunotherapy) on Wednesday which unfortunately wasn't as easy as the first round and has knocked her around a bit, but now she gets to rest, spend some time with her daughter, and plan some trips. As the treatment is palliative, her next Oncology appointment will be to determine if the Chemo has gifted us with more time with Aims, and we can only hope for the best outcome.

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

An X-ray revealed his lung had collapsed and was pressing on his heart, the second time this has happened.
Chris and his family, including their two children aged 6 and 3, now face an uncertain future with no immediate job prospects. Three months earlier, Chris had a seizure in his sleep, forcing him to put his trucking license dreams on hold and seek new employment opportunities.
The family has endured a lot recently. Just after Christmas, Chris's partner Liz had emergency surgery, and three months before that, they lost Liz's brother and her Nana.
We are reaching out for support to help Chris and his family through this difficult time. Any contribution, no matter how small would be gratefully appreciated.

The Dr was happy with the lung inflation so on Friday they removed the drain and Chris is home after 8 nights at Waitakare. 💙 He’s got his epilepsy pills and is on strict orders (from me) to take it easy this weekend before we figure out the next step!

Some not so good news
31 May 2024
Posted by: Elizabeth King
Hey guys. Unfortunately it seems Chris has suffered another seizure this morning in his sleep. After talking to the neurology dept at Auckland hospital they are putting him on anti seizure meds. This means he will not be able to drive a personal vehicle at all for a year and unlikely to ever be able to drive a heavy vehicle (truck)
X-ray today will show how the lung is doing and whether he can be discharged this afternoon. I’ll keep you posted.
Thank you all so much for your support! X

Give Kiri the gift of Time,"Seeking donations to fund the drug Pemetrexed, so Kiri can continue Immunotherapy Cancer treatment (no longer eligible for funding).",https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/185d9df5-e3e1-40a9-a3e3-b1860114fcc6-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/give-kiri-the-gift-of-time,3720.0,0.0,701 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/give-kiri-the-gift-of-time,6 Jun 2024,5 Jun 2026,1,"Christchurch, Canterbury",23,"Kiri is a 57-year-old terminal cancer warrior who is married with 2 children and 3 grandchildren. She is a bubbly, intelligent, & positive woman who is a keen gardener & talented in arts and crafts. She has a way about her that is calm and comforting, and an infectious grin.
Unfortunately, Kiri was diagnosed with lung cancer in June 2022, where the hospital told her there was no treatment available. Kiri did not accept this, transferring to St George's, and paying $70,000 to receive Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy until PHARMAC approved her treatment in January 2023.
In April 2024, Kiri was back in Christchurch Hospital, her treatment put on hold due to her diagnosis of a brain tumour and having to go under the knife twice to have it removed.
June 2024, Kiri has now ben diagnosed with a second brain tumor and awaiting a plan for treatment to remove it.
Kiri continues to live with a positive attitude & fighting spirit. However, PHARMAC refuse to fund the drug Pemetrexed due to a clause in their terms, stating she loses funding if the cancer spreads to another part of the body.
Kiri's Life insurance is only able to partially fund her immunotherapy that she needs to treat her lung cancer, and she and her family need help to fund the rest. This will cost her $617 per cycle.
Please give what you can, to support Kiri's battle with cancer, gifting her time with her family & friends to live her best life. Any support is much appreciated.
Please, share her page if you are able.

Kiri had her final radiation session to treat the second brain tumor today. She has been handling these sessions like the champion she is.
She said it feels weird having her head locked to a table and only breathing through two little holes in the metal mask.
She also said they played 80s music and it was like she was in the clubs!
I have been checking in on Kiri these past 2 weeks and she is thankful that she was having the final radiation session today so she could get started on the Immunotherapy for her lungs next Wednesday.
Kiri continues to have that can-do attitude that keeps her going. She has been a bit more wheezy when speaking to her, you can definitely hear it in her voice, her breathing is sh!t. Some of the medications have made her face swell a little bit, I don't mind giving her crap about her chubby cheeks- and she's happy to give it right back.
We are keeping our fingers and toes crossed for Kiri's radiation treatment to work and kill off that ugly brain tumor that has put a hold on her immunotherapy and caused her alot of pain.
Keep being you Kiri. You have so many people who care about you, who are following your journey and sending you well wishes.

Radiation
24 June 2024
Hello to all who are following Kiri's journey.
Kiri starts radiation treatment for the second brain tumour this coming Wednesday 26th June 2024. The radiation zaps will be done over a 5 day period.
We are all hoping this will be successful for her, to avoid having to have more brain surgery.
Kiri is keeping in good spirits, despite the headaches, nausea, lack of sleep and multiple medications she is on.
She continues to make the most of every day, hour by hour, although most everyday things leave her exhausted afterwards.
We thank you all for continuing to support Kiri to receive her treatments and allow her more time with her family and friends. She really is a remarkable woman.
Many thanks,
Jo

Tumor number 2
17 June 2024
Kiri's specialists have opted to go ahead with trying radiation to treat Kiri's new brain tumor. She will still be needing immunotherapy for her lung cancer.
This means many trips over the next couple of weeks to St George's in Christchurch.
We will post further updates once Kiri has started her immunotherapy again, and the brain tumor has been treated over the 5 day radiation cycle period ahead.
Thank you to those of you who have generously donated to Kiri so far, and to those of you who have helped by sharing her page. She and her family are very grateful.
Please continue to show support by sharing the page to others, asking them to donate or to share as well.

She has now not been at school for 4 months, MOE are taking there time to put her onto a new school.
She is so isolated here, she has no friends and her mental health is getting worse.

One in four people will die with Dementia.
Dementia. The relentless, determined thief.
Sometimes it takes a little, hardly noticeable, like a pickpocket.
Then, the next visit can be like a ram raid. Varying degrees of memory, as well as cognitive and physical abilities, taken away from loved ones, right in front of family members and friends.
Caregivers are often family members – usually a spouse (in our case dad), on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all 52 weeks of the year. Consistency of routine (and caregiver) goes a long way in terms of both quality of care and life for those with dementia.
More can and needs to be done in New Zealand to provide the appropriate level of support for those impacted by Dementia.
That takes money.
On Saturday November 25, 2023 – which is also the 45th anniversary of the Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge - I’m riding a 160km lap of Lake Taupo and hoping to raise a few dollars in support of Dementia New Zealand.

What finished as a stunning sunny afternoon in Taupo started out with a very fresh wake up call on Saturday morning (video above). The Met Service confirms there were south easterlies gusting up to 50kmh, 9 degrees and rain. I had pretty much dried out by Kuratau, then finally, 100kms in and after turning left at Turangi, the head wind became (for most of the run into Taupo) a tail wind. A very enjoyable, leisurely spin all said and done.

Gordon had the use of one hand allowing him to drive, feed himself, use the computer, be independent using his wheelchair to get around the house and outdoors, however with recent surgery for cancer in his hand these small luxuries we all take for granted are no longer possible as his surgeon had to remove the main artery from his hand.

Thanks so much everyone.
Gordon is doing well and graft is healing nicely. The best news is that surgeons have managed to remove all the tumour. We count our blessings every day. The support and kindness from everyone has touched us deeply and we are so very grateful.
Gordon is still unable to get around as he is no longer allowed to use his hand. However we have managed to source a lightweight electric wheelchair which arrives on Friday. He will be able to get around the house for short periods and transfer in and out of the car. It will make such a huge difference to his day.
All your contributions will go towards the chair. Thank you again. I will post a video soon,

Fundraising for Stem Cell Therapy,"Fundraising for a treatment that can bring me back to better health, after 4 years of health issues.",https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/82514678-99ed-4cc9-966d-b15c00e47073-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/in-a-vicious-cycle-of-health-issues-only-getting,4335.0,15000.0,28 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/in-a-vicious-cycle-of-health-issues-only-getting,24 Apr 2024,1 Aug 2024,0,"Mangere Bridge, Auckland",22,"Thank you for joining the page. Your support means a lot, and if you can donate, even better.
I'm raising funds for stem cell therapy.
Below is a topline synopsis of my health journey:
* 4 years ago, I developed a sleeping disorder.
* 1.5 years ago, I was diagnosed with mitochondrial dysfunction and liver detox issues, worsening my health and sleep.
* My vagus nerve became dysfunctional, affecting digestion, heart rate, and inflammation.
* Over the last 1.5 years, my health issues have been getting more chronic and complex, preventing me from working
I’ve spent, seen and tried a lot in the last 4 years - but nothing has been effective.
After weeks of research and discussion, I have found two clinics - one in Mexico and one in the USA - that have confirmed they can help.
Treatment costs, flights and accomodation is $40,000.
I have $20,000.
I'm fundraising $15,000.
I'll find the other $5,000 somewhere.
I'm asking 100 people in my circle of people aware to donate $150 each within the next 2 months to reach this goal (treatment to be done in August). If you can give more or less, any amount helps.
I will thank you personally post treatment. I’ve been waiting a long time to get better, so there will be a lot to celebrate.
Any questions, feel free to ask.
Use of funds
All costs associated with the procedure:
- Tests
- Treatment
- Travel costs (most likely do overseas, as NZ has one clinic and doesn't look established enough to do the procedure for my illness)
- Any other associated costs
If I do not reach my goal then funds will go to the management treatments - Yoga, acupuncture, chiropractice, recovery clinic, SSP (Safe and Sound Protocol) , earthing/grounding apparel etc. etc.","All costs associated with the procedure:- Tests- Treatment- Travel costs (most likely do overseas, as NZ has one clinic and doesn't look established enough to do the procedure for my illness)- Any other associated costsIf I do not reach my goal then funds will go to the management treatments -  Yoga, acupuncture, chiropractice, recovery clinic, SSP (Safe and Sound Protocol) , earthing/grounding apparel etc. etc.","Created by, and paying to a verified bank account of,

Divine was noted as having a cardiac murmur in early 2024 where she was then diagnosed by doctors inland after having a full cardiac workup with Congenital Heart Disease, a Ventricular Septal Defect of 0.5cm with a Ventricular Septal Aneurysm. This ultimately means Divine has a hole in her heart. Open heart surgery is recommended for young divines' health and future. The surgery will cost Divine's family around 400,000 pesos, a number that is difficult to reach. Any small donation will help Divine's health journey and will be greatly appreciated!

Aphasia is caused by damage to the language areas of your brain. Aphasia is a 'hidden disability' with often huge impacts on people's lives.
If you have aphasia, you may not be able to communicate in conversation, you might find that when you mean 'Yes' you actually say 'No'. You may not be able to read more than a word or two. You might not be able to write more than your name. You can feel trapped inside your head, knowing everything that goes on but unable to communicate to other people.
Even 'mild' aphasia can make conversation in a group very difficult and tiring. You can't have a good debate with someone or tell a joke easily. Texting and writing may be hard. How are you going to manage all the parts of your life that need you to have your language skills?
This Aphasia Awareness month we hope that your children or grandchildren might like to try a sponsored silence. This will help them understand a little of how challenging it is to not have words. We also hope that it might start a conversation in your family about aphasia.

After collapsing at work, she was rushed to CWM Hospital in Fiji where scans revealed a critical brain aneurysm requiring urgent treatment. She is now recommended to undergo specialized care in Delhi, India. However, She is open to alternative medical options outside of India. If you have any contacts or guidance for her to consult overseas, please let us know.
Currently, Achal is under intensive care, receiving a regimen of medications to manage her condition and alleviate her pain. Achal's condition requires immediate and costly intervention. The estimated cost of the treatment is approximately $28,700 USD (equivalent to $64,250 FJD, $43,458 AUD, and $46,818 NZD), which includes accommodation, food, surgery, and post-operative hospital fees. However, this amount is subject to change based on in-hospital findings and treatment outcomes.
This is a plea for help. Your donation, no matter how small, can make a significant difference in Achal's life. Together, we can help her get the life-saving treatment she needs to recover and return to the life she loves. Your generosity can bring hope and healing to Achal and her family during this critical time. Please, consider donating to support Achal's journey to recovery. Every contribution counts and brings us one step closer to saving her life. Thank you for your kindness and support.

He has been diagnosed with CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) due to a complication from a prior surgery.
Your kindness and generosity will make a massive difference in his life.
Maneesha was running a successful business as a sound engineer with his PhD before his illness.
Maneesha has been suffering from CKD for eight years. He is on Hemodialysis twice a week and is waiting for a Kidney Transplant. He also has suffered two heart attacks and has three stents inserted. His left leg has been amputated below the knee, which requires him to wear an orthopedic mechanical leg.
His treatments and medication costs are expensive. Hemodialysis costs him more than SLR 40,000(NZD 200.00) per week, and he needs around SLR 125,000(NZD 612.00)per week to cover his medical expenses.
So, Maneesha and his lovely wife Svetlana have started selling lunch packs on the street to cover his medical expenses. However, due to the current economic situation in Sri Lanka, this is now proving to be unsustainable, and he can no longer cover his medical expenses.
He is ready for surgery, and the cost is partially funded, but he still needs more funds to cover the remaining cost. After the surgery, the observation period for the Patient and Donor is one year.
The total cost will be SLR 9 million (NZD 45,000.00).

Dear Friends, Family, and Community,
We are reaching out to you on behalf of our dear friends, Priscilla and Thaddeaus, who are in the midst of a challenging journey that no newly married couple should ever have to face.
On April 22nd, Thaddeaus woke up with an excruciating headache that quickly revealed itself to be much more than a typical migraine. A trip to the hospital and a CT scan unveiled a cerebral hemorrhage, a serious brain bleed. The severity of his condition necessitated an immediate helicopter transfer to Wellington, where the medical team had the resources to handle such a critical situation.
Upon arrival, Thaddeaus was connected to monitors and placed on an IV blood pressure drip to manage his dangerously high blood pressure. Despite being on nine different blood pressure medications, his condition only started to stabilize slightly. Just as hope began to surface, Thaddeaus experienced another severe headache accompanied by nausea. A subsequent CT scan showed that the bleed had caused a buildup of cerebral fluid, putting dangerous pressure on his brain.
In response, the neurological team performed an emergency surgery to place a drain in his skull, alleviating the pressure. After eight days in the ICU and a total of 17 days in the Neuro Unit, Thaddeaus was finally released home. However, the underlying cause of the brain bleed remains unknown, and his recovery journey is far from over.

Those who know Thaddeaus understand how deeply this impacts him. Known for his love of nature and active lifestyle, he is now struggling with mild speech issues, and reduced mobility. Despite these challenges, he remains strong, with his mobility at 90%.
This GiveALittle was set up to help cover the substantial medical expenses that Thaddeaus and Priscilla are facing, as they do not qualify for any medical financial assistance due to their visa status and the nature of the injury.
This unexpected ordeal has been incredibly challenging for both of them. Yet, the love and support from their community have made a significant difference. It’s not easy for Priscilla to ask for help, but the reality is that they need their community now more than ever.
We are calling on everyone who knows and loves Thaddeaus and Priscilla to rally around them. Your donations to their Givealittle will directly support the medical costs and essential needs. Every contribution, no matter the size, is a step toward Thaddeaus’ recovery and a gesture of solidarity and love.
Please, take a moment to donate and share their story with others who might be moved to help. Together, we can provide the support they need during this critical time.
Thank you for your generosity and for standing by Thaddeaus and Priscilla

I'm from Chile and I arrived to New Zealand in May with a Working holiday visa to work in and enjoy this beautiful country. But I never imagined that I would end up in the hospital.
I've got Ulcerative Colitis, and after only a month being here, a very aggressive flare showed up. My colon was so damaged that the doctors had to do a Colectomy (they removed the entire colon from my body) along with an Ileostomy.
My recovery at the hospital had some problems and, therefore, longer than expected. The doctors had to do a second surgery after a week of my first one because I wasn't processing the food I was eating. Then, they give me food through TPN until I could tolerate food again. I was a whole month in the hospital, from 04/07 until 04/08. And even though it was a long and hard time for me, I really appreciate the work that the doctors and nurses did during my staying.
The problem is that the insurance company will not cover any of the cost from the hospital. The invoice from the hospital is $100.000 NZD. But that's not all, as I haven't got residence or citizen, I must pay, not only the hospital costs but also the supplies I need for my Ileostomy (stoma bags, cleaning stuff, and medication), all by myself.
As you can imagine, I cannot afford that amount of money. Therefore, I will really appreciate if you can help me with this.
Finally, if you have read until here, let me say: Thanks you so much!

The hospital I have chosen is close to home and is also close to friends who would be able to visit him, which I feel is important for his mental wellbeing, however the cost of the Premium Hospital Room is not totally covered by his pension, and we are short by $15 per day.
Please please can you help us out with this cost until a standard room becomes available, which could be 3-6 mths. We would be so grateful.

12 February 2024
Tom is settling in well to his “new abode” and he has some amazing nurses and caregivers who make him feel comfortable and cared for, which is wonderful, and takes the stress off of me. I visit him daily, and take him little treats like a coffee or something yummie to eat plus library books to keep his mind occupied.
Tom spends all day in a “lazyboy” chair in the TV room and therefore gets very little activity. The Physio has only seen him briefly twice so I take him for a walk (with his walker) 2-3 x pwk and we do some weight exercises together, his knees don’t allow him to walk very far but as the saying goes “if you don’t use it you loss it”.
For the first 3 months Tom didn’t have any one to talk to (other than me), as the other residence are mainly dementia patients, but this month, a new male resident (10 yrs younger) has arrived in the facility who is able to communicate with him, this has made a big difference to his wellbeing.
Thank you all for donating to Tom’s private hospital care, we are both very grateful but unfortunately the hospital still does not have a ‘standard room’ available, I keep checking with the Administrator and I am on the waiting list for the next available room, however this does mean I still have to pay the extra amount which is $13.50 per day now (I negotiated this down from $15 pd) for a Premium room. Please could you help us out with another donation however small? Aroha nui Tina

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

I'm reaching out to you today with a deeply personal request for support. As someone living with cerebral palsy, the challenges I face are not just physical but profoundly impact my mental and emotional well-being. The crux of my plea is simple: I need your help to acquire a mobility van.
Currently, my essential physiotherapy/gym and hydrotherapy sessions, crucial for maintaining both my physical and mental health, are at risk. The funding I receive no longer covers the costs of the mobility taxi services that transport me to these appointments. Without these therapies, my condition could deteriorate, affecting every aspect of my life.
Moreover, the limitations imposed by my lack of accessible transportation extend far beyond medical appointments. I find myself confined to my home, unable to leave without booking transportation days in advance, and even then, the associated costs are often prohibitive. This lack of freedom not only isolates me but also strips away my independence, a fundamental aspect of living a fulfilling life.
A mobility van would be life-changing for me. It would mean more than just convenience; it would mean freedom, dignity, and the ability to live a life worth living. With a van at my disposal, I could attend my therapy sessions without worry, explore the world around me, and reclaim the independence that is rightfully mine.
Gratefully,
Laura

Unfortunately Luka had some pretty worrying news on the workload side of things and has been told for possibly the next 2-3months there just isn't the workload they are used to and his hours have been cut and possibly from as early as next week they will be cut even morewhich for us is not good. we are hopeful this is a temporary thing and won't last as long as anticipated, but we are starting this low period knowing with all the help we have had from you we have only 1 outstanding bill (had to get a loan to pay large overdue power and internet bills) so for that we are extremely grateful so thank you all for the help and possible ongoing support 😀

Lukas update
7 April 2024
Luka went back to work a few weeks back and he's doing ok, he's had a few tough days but the injection he had in his back seems to be helping and the pain inst anywhere near as bad which is great. the specialist has said if he has another incident where his back pain get as bad as it was they will get him straight to organize a surgery date as the damage will only be fixed that way.
as for our financial situation we are slowly getting there, we have managed to get some road users, a few months of rego and started paying a little off our internet, phone and power bills. unfortunately we are not out of the water and are in serious need of wood for the winter, winter clothes for the kids (including wi ter school uniforms) plus a few overdue bills. we have had many weeks where we had to choose food over the paying bills ( doctor, power, internet) we are going to get there and hopefully in 2-3months we be back on track.
we really are so so so beyond greatful for all the help we have received so far and we truly appreciate all help we have received 🙏🏼

Luka is still off work but we have had a little progress with his injection he had into his spine, he's not in so much pain and is able to move around more which is good. the specialist has said surgery is definitely needed but we just have to wait on surgeon appointment (which who knows how long that will be). financial we are still struggling day to day and have rego, road users, power bill and out spark bill way up high. but we managed to get our service done, kids school books, someone donated us a chromebook for our oldest all thanks to the help from everyone here and a few friends have helped outside of givealittle. we still have a long way to go but slowly we are getting there 💪 thank you all 😀

MRI results 😀
13 February 2024
Luka had an MRI yesterday and they found he's got another damaged part of his spine so he has the lumbar sprain and damage to his L5 disk so they have him booked in Dunedin for a lumbar epidural steroid injection which hopefully is going to help get him back to normal 😁 we are really hoping this works so he can avoid surgery.

next step
3 February 2024
Luka went to the specialist on Wednesday and she did a full examination, she said that his bulging disks have probably gotten worse to the point it affecting his ankle function so he will be getting an MRI to confirm the damage then from there she will organize steroid injections to help with the swollen nerves ect. from there it will be a referral to the surgeon to see what they think.
he has his appointment for MRI in queenstown on the 12th Feb then specialist a few days later (still waiting for confirmation date / time) :)

There, he met my friend Marden and both shared immense commitment to start a life together and still support their families.
The joy they shared abruptly halted when Julius suddenly unable to walk and confined in hospital.
Despite being a nurse, the hospital walls seem daunting to Marden as she waits for any news on her own. Tests, scans, and even biopsies done.
The results revealed Julius was diagnosed with Malignant Lymphoma (Blood Cancer), now having complications of Cellulitis (Infection of the Right Upper Body).
Since their insurance only covers a certain amount of expenses, Marden was advised to prepare some amount of money further treatment. Julius will need to be go back to the Philippines once stable as they are only on work visa.

The company that he works for also promised to keep his job when he’s able.
They are quite positive regarding his recovery and that will also help Julius pay off the bills little by little. All funds raised on Givealittle will now go to helping Julius pay off the hospital bills.

Hopeful than ever before
16 June 2024
Hello everyone, Julius has finished his first round of chemotherapy and has responded really well! As many know, chemotherapy can be really exhausting to patients undergoing it but despite that here is Julius gladly showing off that he’s now able to stand and walk and even wave. Marden sent a video but I have no idea how to upload it here so I took a screenshot. Another great news they received is that they have been advised to stay in Japan to continue treatment. This is a major thing for them as Julius will surely receive continuous treatment and his progress will be more assured because the company he works for will continue to fund part of the treatment. If Julius goes home to the Philippines, he needs to have the funds upfront to be able to receive treatment which will create a gap in his care.
Again, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts with all of your help. All these funds will now go to helping Julius pay off the hospital bills much faster so he can also have ample time for rest and recovery.

Chronic pain, joint dislocations, extreme fatigue, frequent vomiting, constant and severe nausea and other debilitating symptoms have left me confined to my home or wheelchair.
Before falling ill, music was my passion, I loved attending band rehearsals and vocal lessons and I was studying psychology at university. Now, I can only manage doctor appointments and hospital trips with the help of my amazing dog, Honey.
Countless visits to doctors and medical tests have failed to provide answers or relief. To uncover the underlying cause of my illness, my specialist now says I need to undergo specialized tests in New Zealand, sent to Germany for review. Unfortunately, the cost of these tests and review exceeds $8,000-9000, well beyond what I can currently afford since I cannot work due to my illness.
In addition, my doctors have recommended a potentially life-saving surgery if I receive a diagnosis. This surgery offers hope for me to get my old life back, but the cost is astronomical and out of my reach without support.
I am deeply grateful for any kindness, compassion, and support you can offer. Your generosity means the world to me. Thank you for donating to my page.
With warm regards,
Maddie

As of yet there are no updates on the scans, still waiting to hear from the Doctor. Due to my symptoms worsening, I am now on a pure nutritional drink diet, that costs $103 per prescription, but without which I risk severe malnutrition.

Well it did, I got the big C cancer shock horror I felt like id let myself down, in retrospect I went through a stage of my life where I felt trapped, stuck, and unable to change my situation This made me feel angry, powerless, resentful, stressed and sad, all destructive emotions, and all that coupled with reaching way too often for my homemade wine to sooth my sorry self. Over time this lowered my immune system and while I was feeling like this, those tricky cancer cells were unbeknown to me developing inside my body. I am in a lot of pain all day every day. Sadly my retirement benefit is not enough to pay for the help I need, such as natural healers, they are expensive. I need healers such as reiki, acupuncture, Holographic healers, energy healers etc.
Also to heal my body I need organic food, herbs and fresh unpolluted water, all of which are costly too. So here I am dropping my pride and humbly asking you for help so that I can live to see my beautiful grand kids grow up and be there for my precious children, all of whom I love so much.
Can you give a little or a lot to help me live, I am one who loves life and are not ready to leave this planet yet. We are all connected and by giving me help to live on I can assure you I will contribute back to the whole. If money is not an option for you to give then send me love and light and see me healed.

Since birth, she has struggled to feed and so at 5 months old, a feeding tube was introduced, as she stopped accepting any feed orally.
Although she was weaned from the tube at 11 months and started to eat solids. Over the past 2 years, her food intake has been low and unreliable. Her lack of food intake results in her having a very unstable mood
Now she is 3 years old, but unfortunately due to her low food intake, she has stopped growing
and is facing the possibility to have tube reinserted.
Emilia is a wonderful, kind, caring girl, who always asks you how you feel and can identify when someone is upset or hurt. She loves to sing and dance, painting and playing at the beach. But she needs help if she is to grow and to avoid the feeding tube which is very distressing for her and her parents.
Located in Graz, Austria, NoTube has more than 30 yeas of experience specialising paediatric feeding disorders. They offer an “eating school” programme, which includes a 2 to 3-week period of intensive therapy at their clinic, followed by an 8-week period of aftercare to help your child to learn to eat.
Please help her parents to fund this trip so that she can thrive like other children and avoid the horrors of tube feeding.

She was our last grandparent to be alive until 23rd February 2024. My sister and I didn't get to be present when 3 of our grandparents passed away because we live in New Zealand. This time, I want to do something remarkable for myself, our ancestors, and society, by raising awareness of Alzheimer's and donating my hair.
I AM GOING BALD. From 2024, no more thoughts of “what if… I shave my head…” ever again!!!
Before I go bald, I’ll also get a samurai haircut to pay respect to my ancestors 😆
Alzheimer's can impact so many of us regardless of age and there is currently no cure. On average people only live 8 years after their symptoms appear. Every donation I receive means Alzherimers New Zealand can continue to help by funding Alzheimer's research, prevention and support services for people with Alzheimer's and their whānau when they need it most.
While I can grow straight black hair, some others in the world are living with cancer and cannot grow their own, and I’d love to share it with them. I’m stoked that someone can feel great about themselves with my hair somewhere in Aotearoa! It would be nicer than me feeling great with my hair! Sharing is hairing ♥️

This is such a worthy cause and honestly cannot speak highly enough of Building Wellness Taranaki and how they present tools and concepts to the building industry to help with mental health and personal struggles.

Hello everyone. Unfortunately yes I’ve had to re-start chemotherapy and leave my job in order to make my health and wellbeing my priority. It’s definitely been a tough road but I’m still here and still going to give it my all.
So, the latest update. At my most recent hospital appointment with my Haematologist, my team has decided to put a pause on chemotherapy for about 4 weeks as it’s beginning to get into dangerous territory with how my body is tolerating the harsh chemicals.
This is scary news as it leaves a lot of unknowns and creates a new level of uncertainty for the future. Due to my complicated case, there is no medical data or studies on people in my situation. Dealing with both an eating disorder and relapsed cancer going through chemotherapy. My Doctor has explained to me that because there is a lack of information on situations like mine they are unsure of how to proceed safely, as chemo and a stem cell transplant is likely to end my life at this stage.
This has led to my amazing team writing to Pharmac to pose the possibility of me being eligible for immunotherapy instead. While the chances of the government providing the funding for this treatment for me is extremely small, it is still available privately. But at a very very extensive cost.
Immunotherapy is a non-chemo based cancer treatment that has been seeing incredible results. It targets only the cancer cells rather that both cancer and healthy cells in the body. This means that the side effects are far less harmful than chemo and radiation. To receive this treatment, would be absolutely life changing.
So for now, my goal is to pray for the absolute best outcome, and also to get my physical health in the best possible condition so that I’m better prepared for the way forward.
Thank you to everyone for your ongoing love and support ❤️❤️❤️

Your love, support and messages are appreciated. Funds will now be also direct towards funeral costs. Funeral arrangements will be advised at a later date. Thank you all xx
At only 40 years young, JJ, a solo mother of 2 children aged 9&11 has been in the battle for her life. Starting only 2 months ago, JJ has experienced multiple mini stokes. JJ was determined to be at home to care for her children who rely solely on her while waiting to hear of her medical diagnosis, she was then readmitted into hospital again on the 10th of January, later being moved to Waikere rehabilitation hospital. On Monday 22nd of January, JJ began suffering incontrollable seizures and then a major stoke causing massive, permanent damage. Now unconscious and in ICU, JJs prognosis is dire, and her children are now facing a future without their beloved mother.

On December 29th 2023, Heather was rushed from a xmas/new year holiday at Tirohanga Beach Motor Camp to Waikato Hospital when the confirmation of initial tests were received (1st showing as Burkitt Lymphoma Cancer - the worlds most fastest growing cancer, rare to NZ with 15 cases a year), for 96 hours non-stop emergency chemotherapy. This was repeated a few days later with another 96 hours of chemo while further tests were undertaken. It was later confirmed that by half a chromosome the cancer was a fast growing, very aggressive B-cell lymphoma, that required chemo treatment every 21 days for several hours each time. These treatments are still ongoing.
This was a massive shock to us, with no family support around and not being the kind to seek out help. It has put a lot of pressure on Merv who has had to continue to work full-time as well as care for Heather and everything involved in the day to day running of a household. As most are aware the government does not provide much help when illness strikes.
Anything you can offer to support them in Heather's journey will be deeply appreciated by them both.

Rochelle was diagnosed with bladder cancer In 2021. She underwent a major surgery and was left with a urostomy bag and a number of complications post surgery. Due to illness and delayed surgery/treatment in the public health system, she has been unable to return to work.
Prior to her cancer, Rochelle was a vibrant member of the community working as a social worker alongside vulnerable children and families. She coached at pony clubs and was a long time member and breeder of welsh Ponies in NZ.

I am passionate about life and helping, and deciding to leave my life in Menorca to come to New Zealand, Aotearoa and learn the practice Mirmiri and Romiromi, an ancestral Māori practice. I found this technique, in an unexpected and magical way and I came to New Zealand to learn it.
Unfortunately, I have been diagnosed with uterine cancer and I am going to need a hysterectomy and possibly radiotherapy. This means I am not able to work in the cafe I work in to be close to my Māori healing teacher. And I will not receive any salary while I recover.
It will also be very difficult for me to pay for my studies, which I am so passionate about. I do not want to leave this beautiful country without fulfilling my dream of completing this training.
I have found myself alone here and it is very difficult to survive in so much uncertainty.
The only thing I feel is that my soul has asked me to learn this practice which has touched my soul so deeply, and as Māori people say, I follow the path of my soul… Ka hikoi au o tōku oriori…” I also strongly believe that the love you give is the love you receive, or as Māori say… “Aroha mai, aroha atu.”
I deeply appreciate any help you are able to give me to support me during this time, as I heal my own heart and soul and hope to support the healing of other people’s hearts and souls.
Thank you.

An assessment would usually take about an hour, I think we were still sharing stories over 2 hours later, she is a kindred spirit, and I knew that our meeting back in early 2022 was not going to be our last. While I have not been the most frequent of visitors over the last few years due to COVID and me training for new roles & being a little stretched, we have kept in touch. I am honoured that Lisa has the patience to let me pop into her life when I can. I am equally honoured that she has asked me to support her with developing this Give a Little Page. While MND has slowed down her physical interaction in life, it has certainly not slowed down her humour, and her fighting spirit to get the most out of this situation she finds herself in.

Hi everyone, Lisa was able to email me a brief update this afternoon following the launch of the Give a Little page.
In her words....
""THANK YOU SO MUCH, you are awesome, Love it""
She is going through the messages, and really pleased to see the page started.
One of the ""Special Needs"" equipment she is wanting to urgently raise money for is a ""Cough Assist Machine""
Lisa said that there on only one machine for ""ward use only"" in Gisborne. She said she has been to ED twice now and last time with no relief.
Even without voice, her gift of words is priceless. Let's just say the word ""Cark"" was part of the full message I received.
So Lisa has communicated that the machine is quite urgent now and that she will donate the machine to hospice when no longer needed. ""her words not mine"".
Also if anyone knows of anyone with a spare ""cough assist machine"" that can lend one....open to all options. It is a vital piece of equipment. In the meantime....let's all crank up the fundraising - thank you already to the awesome start....

My name is Gina. I'm a 27 year old non-binary person living in Tāmakai Makaurau Auckland. For years I've quietly struggled over an identity crisis that unfortunately can't be solved by something as simple as a haircut or a wardrobe refresh.
Thanks to a supportive network of close friends both in the LGBTTQIA+ community and allies, I'm finally pursuing the beginning of the rest of my life.
While gender affirming surgery in Aotearoa New Zealand is available through public funding, it is subject to some pretty hefty waitlisting. This fundraising page is to help me prepare for a private surgery alternative to minimise the wait time before I can live as my authentic self.
All funds raised will contribute to gender affirming care related costs, including specialist appointments, surgery, and post-surgery treatment regardless of the goal being met.
Kia maia, be brave.

I can't even watch tv anymore due to severe vision symptoms. I am bedridden most the time, as any activity exacerbates my symptoms. I never know what part of my body is going to malfunction next. Doctors aren't very knowledgeable about ME/CFS, and the NZ public health system does not cover ME/CFS related medical care. As a result, I've had no choice but to research my own illness and try to figure it all out myself, with the help of online support groups. NZ has a private ME/CFS specialist, and she's much needed for diagnosis and general treatments; however, I also need to rule out underlying causes, comorbidities and ME subsets - most tests are unavailable through NZs health system, but are mentioned by specialists overseas.

Hey everyone
Thanks again for your support 🫶🏼
I was going to just leave this page to expire as I didn't think it was likely to raise any more, and to put the raised funds towards testing as planned.
However, I have seen a specialist recently who has suggested a few other tests, one only available privately, one only available overseas, and one available through the public system (but only if you meet their criteria, which I don't think I do for the purposes defined by my specialist). All this is going to cost a few more thousand dollars. Hence, I've decided to apply to extend the Givealittle page before it expires, just in case any additional funds can be raised, and just in case people are more likely to support testing recommended by a specialist who has actually seen me in person.
The other testing hasn't happened yet, due to health limitations making progress slow, as well as some minor hurdles outside of my control, and lots of back and forth emails with relevant parties, but it's all still part of my plan, and is still a work in progress.

So he started a wellness journey. About 18 months ago, he tipped the scales at 165kgs
And boy!! He has done it!! Hard work, determination, blood, sweat and tears. He’s done it!!
Kaptin has had amazing support from our gym, and our personal trainer Lynn. Kaptin is at the gym sometimes 7 times a week to keep pushing his weight loss and muscle gain. Kaptin won the transformation challenge at the gym, he also ran a half Marathon - he’s an absolute force!!
Now after a huge loss of 61Kgs, he has been left with a fair bit of loose skin.
Unfortunately he doesn’t qualify to apply for government funded skin removal surgery as he doesn’t meet the requirements as he didn’t have some degree of bariatric surgery.
Kaptin works extremely hard to provide for his family, he’s the absolute rock of our family. The gym is now a whole family situation - we all love going. He has inspired many more people to join the gym and jump on their own wellness journey.
He’s honestly just an inspiration to so many for all that he does and continues to do.
With the funds raised with this we can get him on his way to becoming the best version of himself, inside and out - by having skin removal surgery. Something Kaptin really wants for himself.

"Denied Funding for Rescheduled Surgery to Address Pelvic Pain, Three Years of Infertility, and Recurrent Miscarriages",Help Olivia reclaim her health & start a family. Denied funding after surgery cancellation. Support her journey from Gisborne to Wellington.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/1dc7fc20-9865-4e42-a546-b1740073c843-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/denied-funding-for-cancelled-fertility,1020.0,0.0,137 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/cause/denied-funding-for-cancelled-fertility,18 May 2024,18 Nov 2024,0,Wellington,15,"I can't believe I'm fundraising again in less than a year. I'm Olivia, and my pelvic pain journey began in puberty, worsening after stopping birth control to start a family. Now, at 29, my symptoms have worsened, and I've experienced seven miscarriages. I'm a shell of my former self, missing my old life.
This fundraiser aims to cover my second trip from Gisborne to Wellington for surgery. My laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, scheduled for May 16th, was canceled less than 12 hours prior due to a nurses' strike. I've been awaiting this surgery for 7-months, and the rescheduled date in August—a 10-month wait—is unacceptable since the wait time for appointments was 4 months. I won't receive financial compensation for this because I wasn't referred locally due to hospital incompetence. An HDC complaint is underway regarding the care I received locally. The stress has exacerbated my symptoms daily, and I received no apology when informed of the solution on the 17th of May.
Since 2021, my husband and I have struggled to start a family, experiencing seven miscarriages. This surgery is essential for confirming endometriosis, exploring my uterus, and improving my chances of carrying full term. Despite being on the public waitlist for surgery and IVF, self-referral disqualifies me from financial assistance for a 534km trip and accommodation, as I wasn’t referred from my local hospital.
It's not just about finding answers but reclaiming my health and starting a family.
Use of funds
Your contribution will cover flights from Gisborne to Wellington (534 km each way), as well as accommodation for the recovery period and two days prior to surgery, due to the requirement for blood bank labs to be conducted in the Wellington region.

28 June 2024
Hey everyone,
We wanted to express our gratitude for the amazing support we've received as we're only 41 days away from our surgery date.
We haven't received any updates on the complaint with Gisborne Hospital, but we're staying hopeful and focused. We've been busy contacting the advocate and legal aid as we can't force the hospital to offer assistance. The Health and Disability Commission (HDC) is now investigating the privacy breach from Gisborne Hospital related to my complaint and delays in communication. It might take some time, but we're remaining optimistic.
We've explored different options and applied for a grant from RWNZ. We hope it will be approved. However, as the surgery date approaches, we're still facing financial challenges from our previous trip to Wellington.
Even though the road ahead may be tough, your support and generosity continue to inspire and uplift us. Your kindness means the world to us, and every contribution brings us closer to our goal.
Thank you for being part of our journey.
Love,

Update on Fundraiser
7 June 2024
Dear Supporters,
Just a quick update on our fundraiser and the progress with my health situation:
- The Health and Disability Commissioner has received my complaint regarding Gisborne Hospital. Despite marking it urgent, they can't confirm when we will hear back about this.
- Gisborne Hospital hasn't responded to my complaint about lack of eligibility and creating a referral instead of confirming lack of specialists which would make me eligble for funding.
- I've reached out to local media outlets to share my experienceand fundraiser, but haven't received any responses.
- My symptoms are worsening each month, this makes me think they would have found something if surgery wasn't canceled.
For more information on my conditions related to this surgery, you can check out these links:

All Avenues Exhausted
30 May 2024
Hey everyone,
Unfortunately, we've exhausted all options and the alternative funding options from Health NZ have not worked out, despite their claims of making considerable efforts.
Here is the latest update from the National Travel Assistance Team:
- They won't reimburse travel for my appointments on 16/05 and the rescheduled ones, as these were generated from private appointments and not public hospital referrals despite Gisborne Hospital refusing surgery and not following criteria for referal for Fertility Associates in 2022.
- They will support my publicly funded IVF treatments, including travel and subsidizing accommodation costs for my husband and me.
- They can provide a letter to present to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) for potential assistance, but this option has been looked into prior but aren't eligible.
The public health system has only added to our stress, offering ineligible solutions and failing to refer me years ago despite online criteria.
Health NZ and Gisborne Hospital have not apologized and continue to disappoint and fail me and others daily. Not many people speak up, and I can see why; this has been mentally draining and makes patients feel at fault because the health system holds no accountability.
Thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,
Olivia

Funding Update: Hospital's Unwanted Referral Instead of Letter Confirmation
28 May 2024
Last night, I received a notification about a referral that neither my doctor nor I initiated. This referral seems to be in response to my doctor's request for a letter confirming the lack of specialists available locally. It's concerning because it suggests they may be considering treating me locally, despite the specialised care I require.
This referral could have significant implications for funding, potentially resulting in local surgery without the specialist care I need and causing further delays in my treatment plan.
After reaching out to the advocate service at the hospital, I was informed that they are no longer providing assistance in these matters. I've taken action. I've lodged a verbal complaint, reached out to an national advocate service for support, and was advised to contact the NTA to address this issue which I now have.
While the process has been challenging, I remain hopeful for a resolution as I await updates later this week.
Warm regards,
Olivia

RWNZ Funding Update: Article Published, Funding Challenges continue
25 May 2024
Dear Friends & Family,
Last week, my surgeries for infertility, suspected endometriosis, and uterine issues were cancelled due to a nurses' strike, adding to the challenges of seven heartbreaking miscarriages over three years. This surgery is crucial for confirming endometriosis, exploring my uterus, and improving my chances of carrying full-term and easing chronic pelvic pain.
This journey has taken a huge toll on us, compounded by rescheduling uncertainties and financial strains. We self-funded the first trip for my referral to Wellington.
Despite being on the public waitlist for surgery and IVF since last year, self-referral disqualifies me from financial assistance for a 534km trip and accommodation. I have no updates on financial assistance from the hospital despite my doctor’s letter stating my local hospital lacks the necessary specialists.
The article about my experience is now published on Stuff NZ.
https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/350284315/lot-tears-woman-told-day-longed-surgery-was-due-strike
I am also trying to get a community grant from RWNZ, but I am outside the qualifying zone. Despite RWNZ wanting to help, the criteria are strict, and they need more discussions before deciding. It's the end of the week, and I’ve had no updates on funding yet.
Your support, whether financial or sharing our story, can make all the difference. Thank you for considering supporting us.
With heartfelt gratitude,
Olivia & Callym

Confirmed Surgery Date
22 May 2024
Dear Friends and Family,
I have some important news to share. After my surgery was canceled last minute due to a nurses' strike, I have been given a new date. My surgery is now scheduled for the 8th of August.
This surgery is crucial for addressing my pelvic pain, suspected endometriosis, and issues with my uterus. It brings us one step closer to finding answers and improving our chances of starting a family.
We are still facing travel and accommodation expenses for this second trip, as our initial funding request was denied due to the self-referral. However, we are actively seeking support. My GP is reaching out to Gisborne Gynaecology Outpatients to request a letter of support, which we hope will strengthen our case for funding.
Your continued support, whether financial or through sharing our story, is greatly appreciated and makes a huge difference.
Thank you for standing by us during this challenging journey. Your kindness means more to us than words can express.
With heartfelt gratitude,
Olivia & Callym

We create this page with great sadness as Whāea Karen has been fighting an illness that we thought we could beat. Only to be told in December 2023, she is terminal. The treatment suggested by doctors is not funded and has an incredibly low success rate, with no promise of quality of life during the treatment. Due to this Whāea Karen has chosen to live life to the fullest, as only mum would.
Unfortunately, some of the medication she requires to assist her pain and keep her comfortable is very expensive. Whilst she needs this medication, she also needs to be able to enjoy what time she has, and not stress about the financial burdens of life.
Whāea Karen and her family ask that we all come together to support her through this difficult time. Your contribution will help ease the cost of her medication and everyday living expenses, allowing her and James (husband), to focus on creating lasting memories with friends and loved ones.

A plea to help out with life saving cancer treatment for Ilze Steenkamp,Please help Ilze get the treatment she needs.

In 2017 at the age of 26, I was diagnosed with stage 3 Ovarian Cancer and had since then been fighting and giving my all.
I received my first round of chemotherapy and radiation in 2017 and 2018.
I was fortunate to be in remission for more than a year but my cancer returned in 2019, and my 2nd round of chemotherapy and radiation started in 2020
I had another short period of remission, and my cancer returned for the 3rd time in 2021.
In 2022, I received a 4th round of chemotherapy.
I was also recently diagnosed with a somatic BRCA mutation.
While receiving treatment, I studied towards my degree, graduated in 2020 and now live my longtime dream and passion as a teacher.
After 5 years of chemotherapy and radiation, my treatment options have started running out, and my body is tired. Should I continue with chemotherapy, some parts of my body will start to fail.
Lynparza is a new drug available but sadly not covered by medical aid. This is a treatment of relapsed advanced ovarian cancer with the BRCA mutation and this is the last hope of extending my life.
I have now been on this new treatment for 9 months and I am very blessed to say that is has been life changing. For the first time in years, my life has felt normal. If I do not continue this medication my health will deteriorate again.
All funds raised will be used for my medical expenses. I believe I still have so much to offer and my story is not over yet.
Please consider donating to my fund. Every little bit will helps.

My 2024 goal is to accept this body that went to war for me!
Daily many people ask me if I'm pregnant, and most people won't understand the feeling the question brings over me.
But this is the pathway God had put me on and I need to find acceptance with this.
I'm extremely grateful to be alive and I know it is a miracle that I am writing this message today.
In 2024 I challenge you to accept your body, and I promise to try accept my battle scars and see it as an opportunity to tell me story!

This page is made on behalf of Malandra by her friends.
Malandra is currently battling with cancer. She was diagnosed in 2022 and has recently been informed that the cancer is beginning to spread to the rest of her body. She is currently on a trial treatment in Aotearoa but unfortunately, that is ending. Turkey has fewer restrictions around cancer treatment and there are some options over there for her to get treatment. Mal's first consultation is in October and will last around a week, this will be followed by 18 months of treatment next year. The funds from this page will contribute to both of these.
Getting Malandra's permission to make this page has been difficult as she does not like asking for help but we, her friends, believe that there are people out there (strangers and friends) who desperately want to see another person defeat cancer. Malandra constantly gives all of herself to her friendships and jobs, she is hilarious, kind-hearted, intelligent, and an absolute treasure to everyone who knows her. Our lives are better for having Mal in them and we hope and pray desperately that this treatment will help her win this battle.
Thanks!

This was so that she could build with it, and use this as a therapeutic distraction while in hospital; somewhere she had been for several months.
What happened next absolutely blew her mind, with people reaching out to Lauren not only from NZ, but across the globe! While some people sent a spare set or two, some people even purchased brand new sets for her. People often picked sets that meant something to them personally, so that they could share their own love for LEGO® with Lauren in a unique/ special way.
With a lot of fear and uncertainty throughout the hospital due to COVID-19, and with the ward regularly going into lockdown due to a Covid outbreak, this LEGO® became a very welcome distraction. It also helped Lauren in her recovery both physically and mentally, and kept her hands busy and strong.
To pay it forward, Lauren decided to create 'Lauren's Brick Library', and loan out some of the sets to other disabled and chronically ill young adults to build, and to help as a distraction when they were either going through a rough time, sick at home, or stuck in hospital.
This year, Lauren intends to make her library an official charity, and to expand her loan services to include all of NZ. While she hopes to continue working with the library's existing clients and donors, she would love to reach more young people across NZ.

The biggest thanks to everyone who has shared our mahi, donated, and supported our Givealittle and socials so far. It's been incredibly exciting to share LBL with a wider audience, after being in a much more grass roots phase (and a bit closer to home) for most of the past year.
Thank you for your love; your messages; and your enthusiasm for a project I am extremely proud of. I can't wait to share more, and to see what happens next!
The picture attached is myself and one of our regular donors, Eli, who aims to donate two sets a month. Love your work, Eli! Thank you so much for all that you do.

Got pushed into getting my left breast removed and was refused reconstruction.
I have 5 rejection letters and have tried every possible thing to get reconstruction through the public system with no luck.
Currently have an appointment on Friday 12/01/24 to see a plastic surgeon in tga. The appointment alone is $420 and have been quoted between $40_$80k for the operation.
Having my breast removed has ruined me.
I don't go anywhere or socialise I'm struggling and really need help. I raised just out $1000 so have at least $39000 to go.
It's not what it looks like to others but how it feels and looks like for me. I can no longer wear what I like and am in tears every because of it all. Any and all help is muchly appreciated.
Thank you for reading.

I had my last expansion on Wednesday.
It was 5 in total and I'm very relieved that part is over.
My next operation has gone up in price it's now sitting at $33000 as IV asked them to take everything out of my right side so I never have to go back again. I'm so nervous just needing it to be over. Looking forward to trying to get back to normal I'm over this journey.

After the devastating Covid-19 Epidemic both our parents were retrenched resulting in them losing their Medical-aid/Insurance, leaving their health in the hands of the state hospitals. Both the diagnosing dr as well as the private Oncologist have expressed concern that our mother needs urgent care and treatment. Our pleas to the state hospital for an urgent appointment has fallen on death ears. They have informed us that the first appointment they can give her is in 1 year. The Drs have done their best to express the issue but no luck. The Private Oncologist who has looked at her results and scans will take her on immediately and have her on treatment as soon as possible and we are so great full for his commitment and empathy – Because he is a private doctor and not a state employed doctor the costs will be high. After further testing, he will decide to start with Chemotherapy or send her for surgery. Either way our parents are looking at a very high price tag on saving our mother from Cancer. Medical treatment out of pocket in SA is astonishing and with State facilities overcrowded and underfunded we are forced to go the private way.
We desperately need your help to help our mother get treatment. Every small donation will help in her fight. We Thank you for your contribution. She means the world to us and she is priceless, unfortunately medical treatment is not.

This has been done and the surgeon is currently putting a plan in place for the surgery. He has readvised this is a complex surgery and has said he will have another surgeon with him.
Once plan and quotation is in place I will then send to my insurance provider to approve 🤞.

I hope this message finds you well. I am on a personal journey to embrace my true self and undergo gender affirming surgery. By contributing to this fundraiser, you can actively participate in making a huge difference in someone's life. This operation will be an essential step towards aligning my body with my identity. I kindly ask you to consider donating towards my cause. For me, this journey involves undergoing gender affirming surgery, an important and life-changing procedure. This surgery is not only a physical transformation; it is also an emotional and mental one. It will provide me with the confidence and security to live my life authentically.
However, the financial burden accompanying gender affirming surgery can be overwhelming. Medical expenses and associated costs create a significant barrier for many individuals seeking gender-affirming procedures. Your donation, no matter the amount, can help lift this financial burden and contribute to my journey. Being trans in Aotearoa is becoming scarier and more dangerous by the day, If I am able to go though this surgery I will be able to live confidently with less fear about being mistreated. Your support is more than just a financial contribution; it is a powerful statement of compassion, acceptance, and equality.
Thank you for taking the time to read. I am immensely grateful for your consideration and generosity. Lots of Love xx

However Zimbabwe uses USD$ which means $12000 NZ is only US$7000. I have increased the goal amount to reflect this. Eurika - Page creator.
This is Luke’s request….. I write with much hope that you might be able to assist me regarding the following medical issue.
My wife Skye needs to have spinal fusion surgery done. She has been suffering from Lumbar discs herniation and nerve root compression as well disc desiccation in the L4 and L5 level.
I am appealing and asking for any assistance, sponsorship or donations towards towards having the surgery done.
Please see below the costs of having the surgery done.
Dr G Mwale (Surgeon) $ 4070.00
Mater Dei Hospital. $ 4500.00
Dr N.S Dube (Anaesthetist) $ 2100.00
Surgical Assistant. $ 300.00
Jemesin Enterprises. $ 800.00
TOTAL COST. $11770.00
Copies of the quotations and the MRI report will form part of this appeal to show that our case is genuine and my beloved wife, is in so much pain. She needs her life back.
Any help and assistance will be grately appreciated.
For any further information and queries please don't hesitate to contact me.
Many thanks and best regards.

2 January 2024
Further to our latest update, we are super excited to share some video footage of the hospital in India and the neurosurgeon Dr. Mazda Turel who talks us through the procedure. We really need your help to get Skye to this medical facility and to get her spine sorted so she and live and walk pain free.
The video is a testimony from an Indian lady who underwent surgery after suffering backpain for more than 15-20 years and is now pain free. Her testimony is in her native tongue but look out for the subtitles in english.
Only the first page of the Hospital quote is shared here (the page only allows one image and video per update) you'll find pages two and three in the photos on the main page.
Please share this page with your friends and family.

Exciting News for the New Year
2 January 2024
Happy 2024 from Luke and Skye to everyone. As the title suggests, we have indeed had some very exciting news. While we are still far away from raising our goal amount, we are closer to a cheaper alternative to surgery in Zimbabwe. While Zimbabwe's private medical sector is world class, it is also unfortunately far beyond the reach of most people on a nominal salary. We have been referred to the spinal unit at the Wockhardt group of Hospitals in Mumbai India and after reviewing Skye's most recent x-rays and MRI scans have come back with a quote that is quite literally half of what the cost would be in Zimbabwe. The surgery and Hospital stay is quoted at US$6400 (Compared to : US$12,000 in Zimbabwe. The costs of flights are not included and are quoted to be : US$2400 for both of us return. Luke will be able to stay with Skye in her room at no extra cost and meals or both are included. The cost of a one week stay in a hotel near the hospital post surgery is also not included and estimated to be US$800. This will bring the total cost to : US$9618. It would be good to allow for contingencies.
The new cost in New Zealand dollars is : NZ$15,183.24
The new cost in GBP is : £7540.06
The new cost in Aussie Dollars is : AU$14,099.79
The new cost in Rand is : R175,494.15
We can see that in some currencies this may seem an impossible goal to reach, but it's not, we only need a lot of people to give one dollar each and the goal will soon be met.

Unbearable Pain
11 December 2023
Skye’s fund is slowly growing, unfortunately it hasn’t had the kind of growth it could have had. We are grateful to each and everyone who has contributed and who continue to support the family in person.
It’s getting harder for Skye by the day, the crippling pain means she has to be on regular pain medication, most of which also make her drowsy and dull her senses. It means she is missing out on so much fun and interaction with the kids and the family.
With Christmas looming - the financial strain of already stretched resources mean a life of survival, robbing Peter to pay Paul and days of endless pain. This means that Christmas, like most other months is going to be a difficult time for the family.
Please keep Skye and her family in your prayers and please continue to share the page to highlight the need to support this worthy cause.
However we continue in faith and hope.

An update on Skye from Luke
19 November 2023
18/11/23
Update on Skye DeWet
Good morning all from lovely Zimbabwe. Here with an update on Skye today.
Skye is battling this morning from the pain and she unfortunately didn't sleep well last night sadly because of of the pain and alot on her mind wondering if she will ever be able to soar again and love a full and normal life.
She has been trying to keep herself busy with her crotchet and she was up and down a little yesterday with Hunter. Sadly her mobility is slowly getting worse but she pushes herself to walk down to the kitchen, or outside now and again when the pain seems to be not so bad; and she can see Hunters Castle and forts and stuff he has been doing and building or show her a trick or 2 he has been working on.
She is holding on and we are very thankful for the love and support and encouragement she has been getting from everyone.
Please help us in our fundraising endeavours by sharing our story and this link, so that Skye can get the surgery she needs to live pain free.
The photo is one of Skye’s crochet creations, it keeps her busy and keeps her mind off the pain.

From Montessori Teacher to Animal Crochet
9 November 2023
Todays update from Skye.
I am trained as a montessori teacher, and I was working as a pre-school teacher before I became a stay at home mom.
As I said in my last update, I have taken to crochet to keep my hands and my mind busy. I’m still learning so some are not so good, I’ll post photos below.
I worry a lot about our situation and feel particularly helpless because I can’t just get up and change our circumstances.
Not only have we been affected as a family by my condition, our family income potential has now been cut. We’ve had some news around Luke’s work situation, as far as we know the company is closing down and moved most of their work out to the mine, as the other mines have failed and have closed down, salaries are late in being handed out because of this. They have also cut down the amount of days that Luke is working.
So Luke is looking for work, to try and support us, currently neither of our sons are in school because we are barely managing.
Because of the pain and and the painkillers I can't even try and teach our youngest the most basics that he will need for life. Our older 2 help me out so much with entertaining him and keeping him busy. They are such angels and I am so grateful for them. All day every day.
Luke and I are so grateful to everyone who is standing with us and around us and donating to enable me to have surgery.
We thank each and every one of you from the bottom of our hearts.

Skye’s Story
7 November 2023
It started about a year ago, the pain in my lower right side of my back. My right leg went numb and then started to dance by itself. It was sore and annoying, my oldest son said that it was practising the drums. 😆. That carried on for about 2 hours before it stopped.
Thereafter I would have back spasms every couple of days so bad that my whole body would shake.
We went to the neurosurgeon and had an MRI done showing that I had degenerative disc disease, went physiotherapy as the doctor had suggested and it went away for awhile. I was normal again.
Then it got worse around the beginning of this year, to the point I am now basically bedridden cause of the pain. Had to get a Walking stick to help me walk when the pain is to much.
We managed to go back to the neurosurgeon and got another MRI done to find out that now I need the surgery.
It is so annoying and depressing as this is all so much pressure added on to Luckas in this bad economy and with his workplace closing 😔, I just feel so useless and depressed.
I have taken up crocheting toys to try and keep me busy and productive.

CHANGES TO AMOUNT TO BE RAISED
6 November 2023
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.
As creator of the page I was so eager to get this page up and running I overlooked a small but very important feature - the currency that I’m raising money in versus the currency needed to pay for Skye’s treatment. Give-a-little is a NEW ZEALAND based fund raising platform but the money we need is US$ because Zimbabwe no longer has an internationally recognised currency, they use US$. Skye’s treatment is quoted to be around US$11770 or to round it off US$12000. At todays exchange rate that brings the New Zealand Dollar amount to $20018.00 I have added in extra to the final amount to allow for contingencies.
** My SINCERE APOLOGIES for not noting this sooner **
We will be posting an update from Skye later today on the background of her injury

We're asking for assistance in softening that gap between the normal income and spending time with her newborn and husband.

On top of this they would love to eventually own their own home which feels impossible right now. We want to celebrate these two beautiful humans. Scott and Renee have been so intentional since the conception of their baby, and we want to continue that legacy. Softening into what it means to be a modern parent, honoring both Scott and Renee's practice of holistic living with the modern every day needs of every family. We thank you for ensuring Baby Malyon thrives in a wholistic and intimate home between her and her parents. Let's be the community that can support them in being conscious parents and assist in their baby’s health and well-being.

Since then, Caidens mum and dad have been actively trying to fulfill as much of Caidens bucket list wish list as they possibly can. Most children who are diagnosed with this aggressive brain cancer sadly only live between 9 to 12 months. Caiden is still here fighting 19 months on. For that we feel blessed in the worst situation.
CAIDEN LOVES BLUEY! Everytime he watches the program he begs for his parents to take him to Blueys house. Of course this has not been possible as Bluey is a cartoon.... until now!!!! Blueys world is set to open in Brisbane in November 2024! Taking Caiden here would be a dream come true to him. He loved his trip to Australia recently, and was gutted that Blueys world wasn't open yet. We promised to take him back if we can raise enough funds to help us get there.
Seeing him happy throughout such devastating times is what helps keep us going as parents. Tomorrow is never promised for our beautiful boy. We hold onto hope for a miracle cure every day... and while we wait, we will continue to create everlasting magical memories together ❤️
Thanks to everyone for your ongoing support and love throughout this nightmare we are all living. We appreciate you all so much ❤️

A Cancer Warrior extend closing date
10 August 2023
II would like to extend the closing date till end of November due to change of circumstances and the time it’s taken to get the page up and running .This would give me time to share and post my page to friends, family and those whom would like to contribute.I fight each day encouraging and sharing my journey with others starting their own journey.
It’s not what you can’t do but doing what you can and surrounding your self with other minded people and the love of family.
Though at times I find I don’t have the strength the faces of my children and grandchildren cause me to dig deep within and their love gives me the strength to be a Dad and Grandad

Once in Invercargill’s Emergency Department she was sent for numerous test and was told the heartbreaking news she had rare and mutated form of an incurable Stage 4 Brain and Lung cancer, she was then flown to Christchurch Hospital where they operated on her brain to remove as much as the tumour as possible and release the swelling.
Cherie now has continuous immunotherapy every three weeks and has had 2 rounds of radiation therapy with more to come, her doctors have said these treatments will not remove her cancer but hopefully make her time left with us easier.
During her most recent appointment she was told they found more tumours in her brain and that she possibly won’t be with us for the new year, so we want to make this time she has left with us the most enjoyable, stress free and try to complete with her all the things she’s always dreamt to do while she still can.

We exchanged conversations and video chats until we both decided that I would visit her in the Philippines to meet one another. After returning home, we decided that I would come back and get married with her on Nov. 09, 2022. Fe and I, spent together 1 year collecting evidences towards a visitor visa application. Happily, Fe got a 9 months visa so, I went over to Sorsogon and took her back to New Zealand with me.
After arriving in New Zealand, we were in the first stage of getting a work visa and organizing a wedding ceremony in my hometown. Unfortunately, after 6 weeks, my wife, Fe, felt ill and she was diagnosed with renal kidney failure. She started dialysis straight away for her to survive and I organized flights back to the Philippines to also start dialysis three times per week at Metro Health Hospital in Sorsogon which is her hometown.
And, because of the circumstances of this unforeseen event, we are reaching out to people to give a little from your kind heart for her medical expenses for her kidney transplant for having a second chance at life, so we can return to a normal life and spend more

It's a difficult day to day life with lots of obstacles.
MS is a disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord, an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system. The immune system attacks its tissue. It attacks the protective sheath that covers the nerve fibers, causing communication issues between the brain and the rest of the body.
The official MS diagnoses came after a 3 years struggle with the undiagnosed symptoms of MS. Things we all take for granted like using our hands and walking, became a struggle over the course of 3 years.
I’m starting this page to help Marie-Lize with the cost of a much-needed caregiver, physio and meds. At the moment she has none of that. Funds simply aren't available for any of that. It is extremely expensive in South Africa where they live. Losing her income means they can’t afford any of this. She’s home alone all day as her husband works to earn their only income and their 2 young kids are at school. She is bound to a wheelchair and can’t shower, wash her hair, go to the toilet, prepare food, eat by herself or do any daily tasks or chores. She is in real urgent need of expensive, none funded MS medication, physio and a care giver.
Giving into this will help help Marie-Lize’s situation. Every little bit will make a positive difference, helping a mother who is battling through the daily impact of multiple sclerosis.

Hi there to all who have donated and to those who are following Marié-Lize's journey.
It has taken me a while to get to posting this update, because things have need fairly ""uneventful"" in trying to get the fitting help in this situation.
I am glad to report that we have been able to involve a social worker to help Jocelyn and Caleb to understand why mommy is not able to play with them the way she used to and why she is not able to do the things she used to do. We believe that this is something to celebrate. We will be using the donations received to get Marié-Lize some physio therapy as soon as we have the donations cleared for that.
Thank you again for your donations and for following the progress.
We hope you have a great end to 2023 and may 2024 be a wonderful one!

New Zealand has one of the highest incidence rates of IBD globally, and for children, navigating life with these conditions can be even more daunting. Missed school days, frequent hospitalisations, and social isolation become the norm.
That's where CCNZ steps in with Camp Purple Live, a New Zealand-based summer camp held annually to support children and teens aged 9 to 17 living with IBD from across the nation. For many, this camp is a first-time experience.
Camp Purple Live is not just a getaway; it's a lifeline. It fosters self-confidence, independence, self-esteem, resilience, and empowerment in attendees. For the first time, these kids get to meet peers who truly understand their daily struggles. They forge invaluable support networks and form friendships that last a lifetime, making them feel less alone in their journey.
Our next camp is scheduled for January 2025 at Camp Adair in Auckland. This camp is entirely free for attendees, made possible only through the generous support of our sponsors.
Your contribution, no matter the size, will help us ensure that Camp Purple Live 2025 becomes a reality for these incredible kids.
We urge you to watch our video from Camp in 2018: https://youtu.be/cprtJottLHk?si=biFlpDwVeiHBYnUP
About us
Our mission is to make lives more liveable for everyone in NZ affected by IBD. We offer information channels, education and support networks. We seek to enhance their capability to live in a hope-filled environment which will contribute to their happiness.

Funds will contribute to campers and volunteers’ attendance at Camp Purple Live 2025, covering many costs including their travel, accommodation, activities and catering costs.

Due to this I have decided to seek surgery in Thailand and my surgery has been quoted at $9201 NZD. I am limited to working part-time due to disability, and would greatly appreciate any help I can get to access this surgery that will greatly improve my quality of life.
It's taken me a long time to get the courage to ask for help but the dysphoria and pain/discomfort from binding is only worsening with time. It has taken a huge toll on my mental health and my ability to enjoy many aspects of life. Binding has left me with chronic pain, heart burn and at times shortness of breath however I cannot stop binding due to how bad my chest dysphoria has become. I fear I am not only injuring my health but also missing out on the joy life has to offer.
I simply wish to look in the mirror and feel a sense of homeliness in my body. I want to hug my friends, walk down the street, be shirtless on the beach without feeling a sinking feeling in my chest and a longing for a body that is representative of who I am. All the struggle will be worthwhile when I can have that sense of comfort and freedom a mastectomy will provide.
I understand not everyone is in a place to donate but if you can I would be thankful beyond what words can describe. I would also really love it if you could share this page with others to help me reach my goal <3

Kia ora!! Thank you SO much to those who have shown their support by sharing / donating. Unfortunately my chosen surgeon has told me to lose twenty kilos in order to get surgery so I will be having to go to someone else. I refuse to (and cannot) conform to outdated, fat-phobic practices and do not feel confident with places limiting surgery with BMI guidelines. It sucks - the medical system is a challenge as a fat person - but I will not lose hope. I will update the page with cost changes etc!

In July 2021 my brother thought he had caught an extremely bad case of Covid 19 and after spending many days in hospital in agony it was discovered on the 8th August through imaging and blood tests that he had Multiple Myeloma. The constant pain he had been experiencing was in fact broken bones in his back and rib cage. What a battler my big brother is - he is fighting tooth and nail to stay on top of this horrific disease and to stay alive, he kept working right up until only a few months ago, but now, after many more fractures through out his body as well as having Cauda Equina Syndrome he just cannot cope with the intensity of the pain and trying to work, although he still tries to support his family with his beautiful talented art work.
They have all had to move into a caravan as they are only living on Jo's income as a Hairdresser and help from their church. These conditions have proven difficult, with the very cold winter months making his pain worse. Dan can't come home to New Zealand as the medicine for Multiple Myeloma is not funded here so that isn't even an option for him - we just want to make life a bit easier for their little family and maybe bring him home for a short visit one day if he is ever strong enough. Please help us raise money to help my brother. It hurts to see him struggle like this. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

We quickly had her first brain surgery the day before New Year's because of the size and dangerousness of the tumour. We hoped that surgery was enough, however, she relapsed 9 months later. She had two brain surgeries within that first year. We had our third within fourteen months. Due to the rareness of her cancer, there is no clear prognosis or treatment. We do not know what will work best to stop this and so we have hoped and prayed that surgery was enough but considering the frequency of relapse and the growing speed, the doctors realised that surgery was not addressing the cancer sufficiently and so we started radiation in April/May of that year. This bought us a reprieve of about 18 months where we hoped we had won. But it returned.
In total, we have endured 6 brain surgeries, our most recent just last week. We can not keep doing these evasive and dangerous surgeries. The talk now is of palliative radiation, potentially starting in a few weeks once she has recovered.
We love our daughter and she loves life and to be in this situation is horrific, traumatic and terrifying.
So we ask for help, whatever that looks like.

Hey guys,
We have been enjoying a few butter chickens at home recently with the support of you guys, but back in starship tonight with wound issues.
We had surgery three or four weeks ago to remove some tumours , went back to hospital for another few days a week ago due to leakage from the wound but it remains problematic and we have returned today.
Surgery is booked for tomo. Hopefully our stay won't be long and this will mean she can finally get back home to our family.

My name is Grey and I am Transgender. This means I was born in a female body, but for most of my life I have not felt like a girl, and have always wished I were a boy.
It turns out, being Trans is a thing, and I am now making my dreams come true.
I have had a really hard time accepting my appearance since I hit puberty and it wasn't until I went on my gender journey that I realised almost all of that insecurity was just gender dysphoria.
""Top Surgery"" is surgery that removes breast tissue and reshapes the nipples and chest to create a more masculine appearance for transgender and nonbinary people.
My chest impacts my life daily. I hate to see it when I look in the mirror. My clothes don't fit the way I want them to. It affects my ability to run around with my dog. I am in constant discomfort. I spend a lot of money and time trying to hide it. And I will be misgendered daily (Called 'She' or 'Ma'am') until I can chop them off.
The cost of the procedure in Christchurch is up to $26,000. This is not an amount I can fully come up with from my own savings, so I am putting this out there to see how much I can raise in addition. I am applying for a loan for the remaining portion.
At this stage I have an initial consultation booked with the surgeon, Dr Chris Porter, at the end of July. They have told me the usual wait time is 4-6 weeks from Initial consultation, so will keep this page updated.

I am 11 years old and I have Arthritis(JIA). I have been growing my hair for the past 3 years so I can fundraise for Kids With Arthritis NZ (KWANZ). My hair will also be donated to a wig maker.
When I was 4 years old, my mum noticed my right knee was swollen more than twice its normal size. After a couple of months of tests and hospital admissions, I was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). I was also diagnosed with Autism, White Matter changes in my brain and Ataxia.
Over the past 7 years I have had numerous hospital stays with my mum. My life with JIA involves many medications, blood tests and MRI scans. I have been unable to walk for weeks at a time and not able to go to school for whole terms, due to the pain of JIA. I can no longer play at the park, go bike riding and even go to school. Swimming is my favourite activity but sometimes I am not able to do it and sometimes I am not able to cope with others in class.
KWANZ has been incredibly supportive of me and my family. They have allowed me to feel 'normal' and like a 'kid' throughout my painful journey. Meeting other children who have arthritis, made me realise that there are others like myself, and this has boosted my confidence.
I will try to become Pediatrician Rheumatologist so I can help kids like me. However, KWANZ has encouraged me to be the absolute best I can be. I want to support them so they can go on helping other children around NZ who battle this painful disease

I'm a 27 year old intersex and transgender woman living in Wellington, I was born with a condition called partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. This means my body doesn't really respond to testosterone and caused my body to feel really wrong growing up, particularly at puberty once things started happening a lot differently.
Although I've come to terms with certain aspects of my life such as the fact that I will never be able to have my own biological child due to being infertile there is something that I can't come to terms with and that stops me from being able to live my life like any other young woman.
Although from the outside you wouldn't notice anything different from any other woman, I still have features of my anatomy that I'm not happy with and cause me great distress. The reason I have started this page is to raise funds for me to have a vaginoplasty to make my body feel anatomically correct and enable me to move forward with my life.
The surgeons who are able to provide the surgery in NZ are very expensive and don't offer the techniques that are best for my situation.
It's very difficult for me to save enough to afford this myself as I am a student and I work as a peer support worker providing crisis support and info to trans and gender diverse people in Aotearoa. I also live with a cardiac condition and autism which makes things tough.
Your help means the world to me and will enable me to live a full and fulfilling life like any other young woman.

Christine has also suffered a stroke leaving her with limited mobility on her right side requiring physiotherapy and rehabilitation. With 6 children, 9 grandchildren number 10 on the way she has so much to live for. Unfortunately with Christine's Lipid levels rising its imperative that she receives the treatment needed to prevent further risk of heart attacks, stokes or worse. Currently the only medication left to try is a Non Funded medication (PCSK9 inhibitors) and comes at a very high cost of $800-$1000per month for 6 months. With times already being difficult I cant imagine how it feels knowing you cant pay to save your life.
Christines nature is to not want to bother any one but be there for EVERYONE. Over the years I have watched Christine give selflessly to others, always willing to help and support whoever she is around. For many years she was the support network for many young people who have now grown into productive successful adults who hold a special place in their hearts for Mama Christine. As her friend I'm asking for your help to support my friend so she can receive this life saving treatment and the opportunity to watch her grandchildren grow up. This treatment is essential and desperately needed for Christine and we appreciate any support we can receive.

Their 4-year-old Esmé has 1p36 Deletion Syndrome and just had heart surgery on May 20th. She is now in hospital with an infection from her surgery. Esmé is having 2 more surgeries once she recovers from this one. Esmé's journey includes extended hospital stays and she’s the youngest Kiwi to have had pacemaker surgery.
In October 2023, Lucy had an unexpected health decline and Antonio had to sacrifice his career to help Lucy care for their disabled child, toddler, and infant son. Both unable to work, they started to seriously struggle financially. Lucy has been diagnosed with chronic pain and mobility issues but her condition remains undiagnosed due to a long waiting list for MRIs, leaving her in constant pain.
Antonio has to drive all over Auckland everyday to maintain family responsibilities plus their other children’s schedules while Lucy and Esmé are in hospital. The hospital doesn’t provide Lucy with food or meals, even though she can’t leave Esmé’s side. These things alone mean being in the hospital is costing them over $100 a day in just meals, petrol and hospital parking.
The Gabriels would like to thank everyone who donated to their first fundraiser. They were able to schedule Lucy’s surgery and MRI, pay for various GP and urgent care visits plus costs while in hospital with Esmé on several occasions.

In May, Bruce was referred to have an Xray & CT scans, which showed something so he was then referred to have an MRI scan, which confirmed he has early stage 3 Bone & Kidney Cancer.
A plan has been made for his treatment, starting with Radiation. This will mean time away from Nelson for him and his partner.

We need your help to fund our groups.
A dissociative disorder is a coping strategy that involves experiencing a loss of connection between thoughts, memories, feelings, surroundings, behaviour, and identity. Dissociative disorders arise as a reaction to overwhelming, distressing, or painful, events and help push away difficult memories. Symptoms can range from memory loss to an alter system of many disconnected identities.
This group teaches a variety of coping skills that help individuals deal with past trauma, instead of having to use dissociation. The group will also use art therapy, which provides participants a unique experience. While talk therapy focuses on eliciting various states and verbalizing traumatic material, art therapy provides a safe space for nonverbal expression. Through art, participants can tell their stories without relying solely on talking, accessing hidden memories and emotions in a comfortable and empowering way.
These coping skills and strategies are crucial to trauma recovery and will enable participants to 'not just cope,’ but to actually heal.

I’ve had gender dysphoria for many years but not had the words or knowledge to understand what this was, let alone the education or role models to know I could actually do something about it.
For a long time I ignored these feelings, fearful of the consequences transition might have for my relationships (and safety!). However with support of my amazing friends I’ve finally embraced being me and am so much happier in myself! I now generally get gendered correctly by strangers, however have to wear a binder to be gendered correctly which is super uncomfortable - and unsafe for exercising. I work in conservation which is very physical, and tramping is my mental health outlet so this is really hard to deal with!
In the Canterbury/ West Coast DHB only 5 funded top surgeries are performed annually, and to even get on the waitlist you need ‘persistent and well-documented dysphoria’ from a psychiatrist/psychologist. Even if I had the knowledge to pursue this I wouldn’t have been able to afford to for most of my life! The other options are private surgery in NZ, which runs $20-30k, or heading overseas which is around $15k. I’m saving hard myself as well and any contributions are hugely appreciated for my quality of life!

I am in urgent need of help and I’m hoping there are some kind souls out there that might be able to help me. Many years ago I had a misfortunate event of falling over and smashing out a lot of my front teeth. I was new to Nz and didn’t know I was able to get it done with ACC.
I thought to wait and get it repaired when I could afford it. Fast forward years later, the rest of my teeth were breaking away regardless of how many times brushed. I went to a dentist a couple of years ago and was told it would cost me about $30 000 to get the procedure done. I decided ok let’s do it so I had all of my teeth removed and got told I had to wait a year for the gums to heal and shrink down.
I have emergency dentures but my mouth has such a bad overbite that my bottom plate doesn’t hold because of my tongue and keeps pushing it out. The top plate kept cutting away at my gums so I couldn’t wear it. I went in to get the permanent dentures done and then I was told it was $30 000 per jaw not for the whole procedure. I now can’t afford it and can’t even afford a loan as my repayments will be too high because looking after my two beautiful kids means more than getting this done for now.
My weight is dropping dramatically and I’ve gone from 80kgs to 64kg and it’s now affecting my health and mental health. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated and I thank everyone who is able to help me get my teeth back and be able to eat again and be healthy again physically and mentally.

We managed to raise funds to help her with the unfunded treatment of Keytruda, travel costs and other expenses which were impacted when Kelly had to stop work which affected her families income.
We are now nearly 1 year and 5 months on and Kelly’s journey thankfully still continues. In August 2023 Kelly started noticing difficulties with her vision and balance so after an MRI was completed, they found that the cancer had unfortunately spread to her brain. This was devastating news to Kelly and her family. Kelly then had to undergo full head radiation to try and eliminate the 16 brain metastases that were found on the scan. This was a long and unpleasant part of the journey for Kelly, but she has managed to push through this, and the last scan results show that the radiation has worked and she is stable.
Part of her treatment regimen now is having Vitamin C infusions, CBD Oil and THC (which is unfunded and costs $2,700 per month) in conjunction with her Chemotherapy treatment. As Kelly is still unable to work or drive, we would like to see if we can raise some additional funds to help assist Kelly and her family financially with this ongoing cost which is helping her battle with this terrible disease, giving her the best chance at keeping it stable and being able to enjoy her time with family and friends.

He has heart failure, and on top of that, over the last few months he has experienced quite a few heart attacks which has made life even harder for him.
He is ending up in Hospital often, and last week the doctor called to tell us that his heart is now in continuous distress, and that he is at very high risk of having a big heart attack at anytime and passing away.
This news came as a shock to us all, especially him and it’s hard not knowing how much time we actually have left with him - although it doesn’t seem much.
In light of this he has created a bucket list of things that are important to him, that he would like to experience before he dies.
We want to help him accomplish as many of these things as we can, but we need your help!
Some of the Bucket List include:
- Going in a hot air balloon
- Being a passenger in a racing car
- Visiting Family in other parts of NZ and more!
It is going to cost a bit to tick off his bucket list, as we have to factor in family members being with him to care for him, and extra money to stay somewhere if he ends up needing to be in hospital somewhere outside of his home town.
Any donations are greatly appreciated and will help us make Murray’s bucket list dreams come to pass.
Thanks,
from all of his family.

She is a super positive person and always laughing and smiling even though she is terminally ill.
Her oncologist has spoken to her about a drug called Enhertu, which may give her a few extra years as we don't want to loose her yet but the price tag is $170,000.00, which is a crazy amount of money and not funded in New Zealand like so many other drugs.

But on top of that I have chronic endometriosis which causes other health problems and interferes with quality of life. I can't hold down a job or have intimate relations. Simple things such as planning outings that need to be planned ahead, or engaging in meaningful volunteering or involvement in my community are just impossible.
I would be looking at a 3-5 year waiting time to have a laparoscopy that I need to have in order to surgically remove lesions. On top of that, once lesions are removed the conventional healthcare system can only offer synthetic hormones to manage the endo going forward. I cannot tolerate synthetic hormones at all as they all make me very sick. I have battled this condition all my adult life and have struggled with quality of life issues that have resulted in all sorts of problems. Frankly, I've had a gutful of living like this.
I now know that there are plenty of management options available to me in the integrative medicine field as well as in the field of traditional Chinese medicine. However proper quality healthcare costs money, and largely thanks to this condition ravaging my life, it's money I don't have. I really want to get better, and I really want to have a quality of life. I would love to be able to contribute meaningfully and positively to my community. But in order to do that, I need to get better, and I need to get this condition under control and managed.
Use of funds
Funds raised will go towards:
* Seeing a private gynecologist with the goal of having a timely laparoscopy to surgically remove lesions
* Accessing integrative health care professionals (functional doctor, naturopath, acupuncture etc) who can help me manage my condition without resorting to synthetic hormones.
If I do not reach my goal, I will prioritize integrative health care.

We would like to ask for your generosity to help Jeffrey, who just recently got involved in a motorcycle accident in the Philippines. He was one of those who lost their jobs last December and were unable to go back in New Zealand. We really appreciate any donation, no matter how small, toward his medical treatment and recovery.
We have created a Give a Little page in hopes to assist Jeffrey, and we really hope that the kindness of our community will provide him with the support he needs.
His family will be very grateful for any financial assistance we can provide. Salamat po! <3

Kahn (15) has a very rare genetic syndrome called Wolfram Syndrome. They are currently doing trials in the USA to help slow down the effects Wolfram has on its carriers. Kahn is legally blind, is a type 1 diabetic (water and sugar), has anxiety, has trouble hearing and other health issues. The specialists in the USA are looking at starting trials here in the near future so I want to make sure we are prepared for anything that comes our way and that money won’t stand in the way of helping Kahn and possibly putting a stop to the progression of this horrible condition.
We are currently waiting for confirmation of the starting date for these trials in the USA.
If for any reason these trials do not go ahead, funds from this page will go to the following organisations who help with Wolfram Syndrome
https://www.elliewhitefoundation.org/
https://thesnowfoundation.org/
The photos below are a snippet of what Kahns life is like and the things he used to be able to do like rugby, motocross etc these things he has had to give up sadly. Kahn still participates in Taekwondo but this is getting difficult for him. Kahn absolutely loves school and is year 11 this year and is doing so well with gaining his credits. School is the only thing he feels he still has control over in his life and these funds will help him gain so much.

Being AFAB (assigned female at birth), I have struggled with intense chest dysphoria since I was young. To feel happy with my body, I use KT tape and binders daily to compress my chest. However, these methods have terrible effects on my body i.e., tape causes blisters and scars, while binders restrict my breathing and can’t be worn for more than 8 hours. My chest dysphoria is so bad that I push through these pains.
New Zealand’s healthcare system is dismal for LGBT+ minorities, especially trans and NB people. Public funding for this surgery is not possible for me, simply due to the extremely limited resources, i.e., not enough surgeons and wait lists being years (literally!). It’s disappointing. Therefore, I have decided to do it privately. My surgery has been quoted at $18-20K with a Dr in Wellington, which includes all surgery-related costs.
This process is daunting, and I rarely ask for help, but I quickly realised I wouldn’t be able to achieve this on my own. This surgery is very important to me. It is lifesaving surgery. Feeling like you don’t belong in your body is unpleasant, and I wouldn’t wish this feeling on anyone. Top surgery would improve my mental health and confidence in my physical body. This surgery would be a dream come true and means living in my true form.
Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Any donation would be greatly appreciated!

That's why attending the New Zealand Tango festival is such a significant milestone for me. It's a chance to reconnect with my passion for dance and celebrate how far I've come in my recovery journey.
But I can't do it alone. As a long-time volunteer for the festival, I know just how much goes into making it a success and like to be part of that. That's why I am reaching out to ask for your support. With extra travel and recovery days needed before the festival, as well as the added expense of staying centrally located to minimize walking and manage my energy levels, every bit of support will make a huge difference in making this trip possible.
I know it won't be easy, but I am more than ready to take on this challenge. And if for some reason I am unable to attend, I promise to put the funds towards reaching my next milestone in my journey of recovery.
So please, join me on this journey and help me make it to the New Zealand Tango festival 2024. Together, we can celebrate the power of determination. Thank you for your support.

Thank you so much for your support as it means a lot that you got behind me. I realise I didnt put it out as much as I could as it was creating additional pressure. And this part was a new experience as well. All of you follow me on one of the other channels and spotted that I made it. Im still recovering and processing it all but thank you. have a close look at the video and you will be able to spot me. Yes I actually was there. Still cant believe it as I'm already trying to get back into my rehab routine as there are no days off.
Thank you. We reached a milestone .

One dance at a time
21 May 2024
As a bit of a preparation challenge I went to a few events in a row with different challenges and expectations. Not always easy but I got through most of the time and even made it on the floor and was spotted ☺️. Learned a bit more on how I pace myself, block out sound and people. And accept that the important part was being there and stay connected. It’s a long journey and difficult for people to grasp how big these milestones are and what a big one the festival will be in so many ways.

Quite an emotional milestone to be back at this venue at this milonga and even make it on the floor for a few songs. It took me sometime to bounce back from the day but you learn as you go. And it helped to understand how to prepare myself for the festival.

Managed to go through the files a bit and been trying to find the same tracks to make a few dude by side videos. Different periods have different support devices making a study in itself. But you can see the changes . Also visible that she is moving more freely and can trust that I’m not going to fall over . It’s a new level of trust from both sides.

It’s humbling to see how far this journey reaches and ends up reaching across the globe. I appreciate you joining me in this more personal part of the journey. I dream of being able to keep and do things with my family. I believe that will come .
But Tango is a movement driver as it’s the essence of movement to me a d that starts from the ground up. Looking into these magical part of our bodies I kept coming across the shoe issue. So I reached out and to my excitement they responded. Now they are part of my journey and maybe a little bit of other people aswell this way.

It takes 4 years to get to the Olympics, right? #strokesurvivorsneverquit
15 June 2023
I was gearing up to make in this year but to accept that I'm not quite ready to make it all work this year. It was difficult to come to terms with letting it go this year as I felt it would be this milestone showing how far I got. Next year I'll be ready and will be able to experience more off it. Let's make it a count down. And I would love your support , reminding me
""you can do this""
it doesn't take much. $1 per follower would get it done and would be the cool option and take one obstacle out of the way.
Thanks for your ongoing encouragement from different corners.

We work with people Worldwide, in NZ and in Bali. Many people that need serious treatment come to us, and over time it became clear that we needed a base. This Healing Centre project started in 2020 in Bali. It is a place for people to stay for their individual healing... when it is ‘needed’ yes, but just as importantly for preventative reasons.
There will be 5 guest rooms in total. 3 are completed already, and 1 is already open for guest stays!
2 more larger guest rooms are in the process of being built now. The structure is done, just the finishings to go!! We are on the home stretch.
Indonesian locals pay by donation only. So those of you who have booked in for sessions / purchased at www.laurathelabel.com / donated money, time and materials already — we could not have gotten to where we have without you! Thank you! Your names will all be mounted onto a feature wall.

Since our last update….
20 April 2024
- We continued digging the pool, making sure the foundations are really solid
- Continued with plastering and painting
- Fitting the ceilings
And, while buying time before all the big material payments…
- We added a wall and extended the pond down in the main part of the centre (already built).
To buy even more time… we sent our team home for a long well deserved holiday.
This Sunday, 4 guys will return and we must have the materials for them to work with…
This includes…
- Iron and concrete for the pool
- Floor tiles for the rooms, stairs and balconies
- Wall tiles in some areas such as bathrooms
- Iron for the doors and railings
Once this centre is completed we can welcome so many more people that need healing. Thank you so much in advance 🙏🏼

Still hefty payments to make for materials such as floor tiles, iron and glass for doors and railings, concrete and iron for the pool structure!

He has been repeatedly rejected for any funding and we simply cannot afford to pay for care or rehabilitation. Friends, family and flatmates continue to offer an incredible amount of support.
In home care costs $52 per hour. We are looking into rehabilitation options as improvement is possible but difficult (impossible???) to acces through the public system.

This has made my ferratin extremely low and has started affecting me day to day more then just my gastro issues as it also affects your mental health. It's low enough to be dangerous but nor low enough to br funded through hospital for there very very low criteria or sge criteria.
The last top up I got has managed with the two vials to keep my stores high for the longest time this time and I'm trying to make lifestyle changes to also help.
I've tried all other methods to increase the ferritin and my Dr thinks the IV iron ferinject will help. The administration however has to be done by a professional which is a $90 fee to administer I'm an iv over an hour as he is wanting to do two vials of the ferinject 10ml vials.
My Dr is not winz registered so I can not get government help as I tried that first
*I've had one injection before earlier in the year that gave me a massive lift in life and this is to top me up for Christmas and the new year.

This rare & progressive condition has impacted Jason's mobility, speech, & overall quality of life. As a family, we have had adjustments to accommodate Jason's changing needs, installing mobility aids to creating a more accessible living environment. Despite the difficulties, our focus has always been on maintaining Jason's dignity & mental well-being. With three daughters & a grandchild on the way, we are determined to provide Jason with the support & care he needs to navigate this difficult time. One of the most pressing needs is a disability vehicle for Jason. This vehicle would not only provide him with a safer & more comfortable mode of transportation but also enable him to stay connected with the world around him. The cost of a disability vehicle can be prohibitive. Your support & generosity would mean the world to us as we strive to improve Jason's quality of life & help him maintain his independence & social interactions. Living with this illness has presented its challenges, but we have decided to concentrate on the positive aspects of life & maintain a sense of optimism. The resilience & perseverance shown by Jason are truly inspiring, & any assistance in obtaining a disability vehicle for him would be greatly appreciated.

Hauraki Naturally exists to promote and advocate for healthy, innocent, clothes-free recreation in appropriate public spaces, such as beaches, rivers and lakes, forest tracks and cycle trails, and more. We aim to show society that the human body should be celebrated in all its infinite variations of colour, shapes and sizes, and not hidden away as an object of embarrassment and shame. We strive to break down the antiquated taboos around nakedness that cause people to falsely associate nudity with sex.
Mental illness caused by body shame and low self worth is endemic in New Zealand, particularly with our younger people. Being overly sensitive about nudity around children is arguably having a profoundly negative effect on their development and their attitudes to body image. Kids are increasingly seeing false airbrushed and manipulated images of people, which set unobtainable beauty standards for many of our children. Three out of four children as young as 12 dislike their bodies and are embarrassed by the way they look, increasing to eight in ten young people aged 18 to 21.
Scientific research shows that people who spend time in the outdoors without clothing have far less anxiety about their body appearance and are generally happier and healthier. Children who grow up in families where nakedness is commonplace develop into well-balanced, respectful adults with much less tendency to objectify the human body.

Lobular breast cancer stage 3. No lymph nodes affected, had full reconstruction after surgery.
2016 another diagnosis of the left breast, resulting in a third mastectomy and reconstruction. My surgeons cut out the cancer and put in a new implant. Due to grief and work, I agreed to do radiation 6 months after my surgery but was told I had to do it 3 months after, therefore, radiation did not happen. I changed lifestyle, removing all alcohol and estrogen loaded oils.
2018 another diagnosis of a lobular breast cancer nodule in the left breast. Further change of diet, (Vegan), using medical cannabis formulations and essential oils. My doctor encouraged yearly ultrasounds on the nodule for 3 years. The nodule kept growing slightly in size, myth busting essential oils (frankincense) & medical cannabis formulations would reduce the tumor.
In 2022 I had my fourth left mastectomy, followed by radiation for 3 weeks. No reconstruction was offered. I created a new formulation for the radiation site, which has helped the skin heal and keep soft. In December 2022 I saw my plastic surgeon Chris Adams to enquire of a reconstruction. He said it will cost $60,000.00 to go private. Sep 2023, I went to the breast clinic for a checkup, but there is no funding for a breast reconstruction through our hospital, despite being cancer free!
The waiting list is between 5 to 10 years for a reconstructed breast. Please can you make a donation to fund a reconstruction.

Hello
My name is sherrida
So I’m going to share how I lost my eye sight (fully blind). In 1995 I was assaulted by my ex partner, losing my eye to his fist. In 2012 another ex partner assaulted me, with me losing my remaining eye.
It had taken a big effect on my life.
If I didn’t have god in life I probably would off taken my life. I have come to terms with being blind. There is nothing no one can do for me to see again. Now, I have great support around me to help me to adjust to accept my daily living and to socialise.
I thank god for carrying me and helping me to find forgiveness to those 2 guys who did wrong to me.
Thanks,
Regards

During those 8 hours, the rest of the members from my local CrossFit Affiliate joined me to take that total from 5,100 to an enormous 20,493.
This year, The Box Over Challenge will be a nationwide event, for anyone in the fitness industry, to test their endurance and mental capability, however, rather than going for 8 hours, athletes will compete, as a team, in a race to the peak of Mt. Everest, jumping or stepping over a 20-inch box 17,421 times.

For a long time, I have been helping families in Pakistan with their daily necessities, such as food, medicine, warm clothing, rent, and power. However, this time, I am reaching out for your assistance as the number of people in need is increasing daily. Many families are asking for help with their disabled children's medicines, which I am unable to provide on my own.
Therefore, I am humbly requesting your support in this noble and righteous act. Your small contribution can make a big difference in someone's life. Your donation can help them have a better meal and medicine and survive another day without going hungry. Although you may not be able to physically give someone a piece of bread, your little donation can enable them to purchase food no matter where they are.
As we all understand, the AJAR of this act will be AJARE AZEEM. Let's unite and spread love! It's time to think about giving a little to those who most need it. This is the story of the world we live in, our ancestors, and the story of us. Why not take a moment to think about giving? By doing so, you will receive more blessings.
Let's put our trust in Allah and hope that He will assist us in collecting these small contributions for our loved ones. Ameen!

I appreciate you clicking on this page and taking your time to read this.
A little bit about me - My names Jordyn, I'm a 26 year old woman who lives in Otago NZ, and i suffer with a chronic skin condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa.
What is Hidradenitis Suppurativa? Its a chronic skin condition that causes painful, recurring boils and cysts in areas with sweat glands, with mine mainly effecting my groin area.
I had my first painful 'lump' in late 2019, and was diagnosed in late 2022, at the end of my 1st year of nursing study, i am now in my final year.
I have been on multiple medications, with me currently on the last biologic medication funded in New Zealand for my skin condition, called secukinumab (what a mouthful) leaving me immunocompromised. Sadly, as some of you reading will know, public dermatology in the south island has 'collapsed', leaving patients such as myself with no specialist to go to anymore, leading me back to my GP on a weekly basis. Majority of the time, I am also on antibiotics for infections, with the high risk of sepsis lingering around the corner. With my condition being so debilitating, i struggle to do a lot of daily life activities such as bathing, toileting, dressing and mobilizing without the assistance of my wonderful mum.
I understand peoples situations are different, that not everyone is in the position to donate, but even making people aware of this condition makes a huge difference as it is so common, but so rarely diagnosed.
Use of funds
Donations will fund non-covered expenses for managing my skin condition, including GP, nurse, and urgent doctor appointments, medications, skin products (body washes, creams, gels), clothing (pants and shorts), and mobility aids.","Donations will fund non-covered expenses for managing my skin condition, including GP, nurse, and urgent doctor appointments, medications, skin products (body washes, creams, gels), clothing (pants and shorts), and mobility aids.","Created by, and paying to a verified bank account of,

27 June 2024
Happy Thursday everyone!
Had my GP appointment today and I managed to get some more antibiotics, pain relief and my secukinumab injections prescribed to me to cover me for my upcoming nursing placement.
I have been told that my secukinumab funding runs out in September this year and I am unsure of the process after that to get it re-funded as my GP cannot do that, and a specialist dermatologist will have to do this, who when and where, i have no idea.
I have a 30 minute GP appointment booked for mid July and after discussion today, my GP and I think its a good idea to create a care plan for when I have flare-ups, where i need to go to access what i need, and what prescriptions i'll need.
For those of you who are reading and haven't followed along from my social media, while i was in ED for my condition on the 21st of June, i had a urinary catheter put in and it was taken out within 10 minutes due to internal pain that caused me to pass out.
Sadly there was no documentation of this occurring from my doctors perspective having read over my ED discharge notes, so that's a whole other problem in itself.
I begin my final 120 hour placement on the 1st of July, so I'm not sure how many updates I will be doing over that time all going well and health staying stable for those 3 weeks. Then its planning time, and getting me prepared and comfortable to begin my 9 week transition placement!
Again, thankyou so much to everyone who has donated thus far. Massive appreciations ❤️❤️

THANKYOU! + District Nurse and GP Nurse appointment updates
26 June 2024
Hi all,
Thankyou so much for the kind donations that have been made in the last 24 hours. I am beyond words, I have cried many happy tears so thankyou all who have donated ❤️
Today i had a district nurses appointment and I was given these Cavilon applicators to try for a trial to try and get funding for these. I'm really hoping these work as there has been great success in other patients with similar conditions to myself.
I have been told that there is a chance that the district nurses may not be able to fund these, and I would have to purchase these myself.
I have managed to find a reputable supplier in New Zealand that sells the same product in different forms varying from $29.80 to $88.14 so this may become another cost.
I also had a GP nurses appointment today for an injection that me and my GP are hoping may help my skins integrity and also help with my red blood cell production. I was told today that previous appointments were over-charged, so I will update these changes in the donations tab when I have a confirmed list of charges from my health provider, so it more accurately shows what each donation is able to fund ❤️
I will keep you all updated on tomorrows GP appointment.
Again, thankyou so much to those who have donated, and also a thankyou to those who have shared my story on social media/s. Spreading the word and creating awareness is so important ❤️
Ngā mihi nui

First initial finding an inventing company to look at my idea
3 May 2022
Dear Lisa,
This is an exciting time for you and your Language Probe.
Many of our clients have admitted that there were probably a list of reasons why they should have put off taking action, but they quickly realized that if they didn't put their foot down and take charge of their idea, they would spend the rest of their life wondering what could have been.
We'd like to commend you for taking the first steps in our method of presenting the Language Probe to a company to see if they would be interested in it. Soon you will have the personal satisfaction of inventing & pursuing an idea!
As promised, I have included the paperwork that will start you on the path of getting your Language Probe in front of a corporation for possible acquisition. While the information is fairly straightforward and simple, I will be happy to answer any questions you have when we speak again.
Prior to our next call, there are a couple of steps that need to be completed. Below you'll find the specific account information that I created for your project. You will be using it to login to our online secure client portal.
2 Simple Steps to Get Started:

MS is an unpredictable disease no one really knows much about it and there is no cure but there is medication to help deal with it to a certain degree.
To find out I have Multiple sclerosis (MS) to go along with my damaged L4 and L5 vertebrae, asthma, depression and insulin dependent diabetes has made life hard not only on me but my friends and family.
I have at least 5 cerebellum brain lesions and at least 10 lesions on my spinal cord which has given me really bad acute and chronic symptoms such as
Fatigue, cognitive problems, numbness/tingling in my limbs
Ataxia (which is a lack of balance, coordination and muscle weakness and control)
Dysarthria (which is weakness in the muscles used for speech)
Memory problems and other central nervous system problems
I also suffer with a few phenomenon/signs due to the MS
lhermitte's sign
uhthoff's phenomenon
romberg sign
A huge part of MS is it attacks mainly your mobility so before I become less mobile and wheelchair bound i want to do as much with my family as I can I have a 7 year old daughter who is my world having back injuries and MS has made me miss out on a lot of special moments that i can never get back.

I decided to go to the chiropractor and get it checked out and discovered my neck posture was close to being not correctable, as well as my spine being out of place near my pelvis and my pelvis is severely out of place. Along with a bunch of other tests which proved this (balance and right distribution and brain to nerve response) and it’s shocking at my age to be in this state already (19). I also found out in the X-rays that my right leg is 13 mm shorter than my left which will be the main contributer to my pelvis and lower back pain. It’s estimated at 2,000 for 16 weeks of chiropractor appointments to start correcting some of that. But ultimately to correct my shorter leg I will need to look into getting leg extension surgery or something to help get my pelvis even. This affects my daily life as I cannot work for a full day without being in discomfort after an hour into a shift and by four hours it’s unbearable. I cannot exercise because exercising with bad posture will do more harm than good, and I cannot play sport. I don’t want my life to look like this forever but I can’t afford to fix it. I appreciate any help. :)

Just found out why I am in so much pain all the time. Left hip is absolutely destroyed - no cartilage at all. Bone on bone. Hurts like crazy. Can't earn any money. Sickness benefit doesn't match the prices of basic needs.
Just looking for support. Not just money. Some kind words will definitely help too. It's very lonely when you in pain 24/7. Impossible to start relationships. Cannot hang out coz always in discomfort and pain. It's difficult to walk but moving around on skateboard is all good somehow, which is awesome. I exercise all the time, doing my best to stay positive. If I don't exercise, it gets very hard to move around. If I warm it up, then I don't limp. I try not to show my pain. Doing laps on pump track is helping so much with pain relief. Yeah, strengthening hip muscles really helps.
Just had my spinal surgery done and dusted, finally recovered, and now hip. I stay positive. I hope that eventually I will get a new hip, and will enjoy life to the max!

Good Morning Guys,
I got surgery quote. It's $28k. Looks I will spend many years in agony. It's ok. I had a good life. So driving heavy machinery in NZ for 15, years doesn't count. Now I get to wait for some mystery help from public. I applied for bunion surgery twelve years ago and still waiting. Obviously the same with hip replacement.

We applied everywhere. So far got reply from surgeon about appointment. Just waiting now. Surgeon will set appointment date. I asked him to hurry it up coz I am in so much pain. Looks like I have to go private, so definitely will need lots of money. So far people told me - if you can skate, it means you alright and don't need a new hip yet. It's so cruel! I skate so I don't feel so much pain. Doing pump track is really helping to relieve the hip pain. Staying fit and healthy is very helpful for pain management. Not every disability is visible. It takes lots of work before I can go and do anything. Anyway, I need hip replacement urgently. It's last stage of arthritis. Without bunch of meds and exercises - I can't stand or walk. Society is cruel. I ask for help coz I really need it

only to relapse 3 months away from End of treatment in April of 2022 with something docs couldn’t give a prognosis for because they had never seen this type of cancer before.
The family were told it was pretty grim.
Tyson persevered and despite what the docs thought he went into remission again!
Tyson was well on his way to the End of treatment in June 2024 with 8 weeks to go when the family were given another blow.
Relapse. Again.
This time Tyson has Myelodisplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Luekemia.
He restarted treatment on the 18th of june and will need a bone marrow transplant.
This may be their last chance available in NZ.
The Hollran family will be in the Ronald Mcdonald House until Tyson has had his transplant and is ready to go back home which could be months.

I've decided to try and do some good this year, for everyone who has ever been affected by Dementia directly or indirectly. As we all know, it's often the heroes, professional or at home, that are there supporting those suffering as much as the patients themselves that need the help. A few of which being my lovely family at one point.
The challenge itself is a Dry July adaptation. As it is the NZ renowned WCIPA challenge on 26th July. If I achieve the three targets by then, I shall be enjoying myself immensely at it. If I don't I shall remain dry throughout the rest of July.
Three targets being:
1. Raise $1k NZ (That's down you to you lot mainly)
2. Lose 8kg, average of 2kg a week.
3. A 200km movement challenge over the 27 days, averaging 50km a week.
I'll be posting weekly updates on progress for all three challenges so please donate, every little helps!

I'm 23 years old and live in Tauranga with my dog Fig. My life changed 2 years ago when I was diagnosed with Bronchiectasis; a chronic respiratory condition where scarring builds up in my airways, allowing excess mucus to accumulate and become a breeding ground for bacteria. The amount of mucus means small illnesses turn into big infections and the infections create more scarring, which worsens the mucus. The excess mucus means I'm constantly coughing, fighting to breathe.
The inflammation also means that I can't partake in anything cardiovascular, which was a jarring change to my active, normal life as a 21 year old.
I have suffered from lifelong anxiety and have found remedial peace in things like running, swimming, cycling and hiking an opposition to being medicated. I am also a passionate football player, and almost all of my hobbies/joy in life is found in being active outside in some way. The constant inability to breathe has destroyed my mental health and well-being and I spend 90% of my life aggressively coughing. At one point, I passed out unconscious during football for lack of oxygen!
The past 2 years had been full of trips to doctors who have told me I am asthmatic, allergic, or am making it up.
Last year, I finally saved enough for a specialist diagnosis which set me back $4000, a big hit when you are a student and struggling to buy groceries.
Please help me to fund treatment that I desperately need but cannot afford, and help me live a normal life

No matter what this journey may bring we will love master Kyro whole heartedly, and support him the best we can
There is limited research within a ten year timeframe.
Kyro was diagnosed with no nasal bone via scan during pregnancy so did the NIPT test which came back with a xq25 micro duplication, confirmed after birth with a blood test.
We want the best for Kyro and anyone on the same journey.
Xq25 duplication refers to an extra copy of genetic material in the Xq25 region of the X chromosome. This duplication can lead to a range of developmental issues and medical conditions, depending on the specific genes affected and the extent of the duplication. Some potential effects may include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and physical abnormalities. The severity and symptoms can vary widely among individuals with Xq25 duplication. Understanding the genetic basis of this duplication can assist in providing appropriate medical care and support for affected individuals and their families.

This is a long message, but PLEASE read to the end.   My name is Monica. I am in desperate need of financial assistance to help cover my medical bills.  As a child I grew up with my mother in poverty. I have been through multiple types of abuse (including an abusive and relationship). I was never able to get the assistance I needed and had to take out a large loan. I was having breakdowns, falling on the floor crying, having panic and PTSD attacks. I had to be admitted as I was planning a very effective way to commit suicide. I also lost my appetite and would go days without eating, causing unhealthy weight loss. I could no longer function in my day to day life or in my employment (which is very demanding, stressful, and emotionally draining). I have no support from the minimal family that I have, even though they do care and don't want to lose me, they are unable to assist and they also live overseas). My psychiatrist, therapist, family, and friends are very worried about me and want to extend my stay here for my safety.
Currently I am running out of options, and can no longer cope (there is also a large possibility that I will not be able to return to my work for a while).  If anyone can relate or understand my situation, what I'm going through, and are able to assist financially, I will forever be so thankful and grateful    With love Monica

I can't run with her anymore, walk with her, play with her, or take her to her favorite places to fulfill her tiny wishes. Recovery is a long road that requires expensive stem cell treatment or Autocart Treatment for my knees, which have led to muscle loss and fragility, causing further issues.

The only viable solution for my knees is stem cell treatment, but the cost is beyond my reach. I'm looking at treatments both here in NZ and overseas. Unfortunately these types of treatments are not funded by the public health system.
If anyone could help by contributing whatever they can, it would make a world of difference. Your support would help me get back on my feet, recover from this trauma, and be the strong father my daughter needs.

My long lived passion for sports, fitness, and overall well-being has been a driving force behind this endeavor. Despite being sidelined by an injury, which has limited my capacity to engage actively and compete, I am eager to channel my time and energy into contributing to the athletic community in alternative ways.
This venture marks just the initial stride in my pursuit as an aspiring entrepreneur. I am committed to reinvesting in this enterprise to fuel ongoing product development, marking the beginning of an exciting journey.
This is the first occasion where I'm seeking financial assistance. While I'm not accustomed to requesting financial aid, I strongly believe it's the right choice here.

Life is a blessing, filled with little challenges that push us forward.
In August 2022, God called us from Brazil to Rotorua to serve Him in one of our lovely churches here. Ten days before our flight, a routine checkup revealed a thyroid challenge, and one result pointed to cancer.
But in New Zealand, I met Dr. Win Meyer-Rochow, the best thyroid specialist. Good news: no cancer! Instead, he offered me a surgery to remove the nodule, giving me a 95% chance of not needing medicine and returning to normal life.
The catch? The surgery is only offered through the private system. I'm a sporty person, love the gym, and cherish my health. My dream for this year is simple: undergo this surgery, return to normal, and become a mom.
But, I can't have a baby with that nodule hanging around. So, if you're watching my story and want to help a fellow in Rotorua, please click the link and donate through Give a Little. Your support means the world to me.
Thank you, and may God bless you!
Your donation will cover the following fees:
- Hospital Fees
- Surgeon's Fees
- Anesthesia Fees
- Medication Costs
- Post-Operative Care
What won't be covered:
- Consultation and Diagnostic Tests
- Potential Complications
- Transport Costs from Rotorua to Hamilton
With heartfelt gratitude,

I'm fundraising for braces for Rosabella. Her dad Lawrence, is a very good friend of mine who I have known for well over 20 years. He is disabled and not able to work.
His wife abandoned him and their two children when Rosabella and her brother were around 14 months old. Lawrence has brought them up wonderfully, despite his disability. Lawrence has full custody of his children.
Unfortunately now Rosabella is 12, the specialist has advised she will need braces as she has an extremely bad overbite and also a front tooth which is coming down sideways. Rosabella is loosing her confidence over this and is starting to become a little withdrawn. She has started covering her mouth when she talks and smiles and it's a shame to see her like this. Lawrence has been advised the cost of the braces will be around $12,000.00. He has explored every channel but no one is able to help with the cost. This is his last hope. He wants only the best for both of his children and to be able to raise money for Rosabellas braces would be a dream come true for him.

Hi, I work for a charity called TimeOut. We connect generous holiday homeowners around the country who are willing to donate a stay to a person diagnosed with stage 4 cancer or an incurable illness so that they can spend some quality time together with family & friends.
If you are interested in applying or just want to find out more, we would love to help if we can. We are a small charity so we are unable to guarantee we will have a suitable option but we try our best. Recipients can apply online at www.timeoutnz.org or email info@timeoutnz.org with any questions. Take care, Kylie.

I am Liz, I am a Paracyclist and Multiple Sclerosis will not stop me. I have had MS since I was 14. In 2023 I was diagnosed with Secondary Progressive MS which mean that my disease has progressed to its final stage. I have become more disabled, most of my body now has symptoms including numbness, weakness, loss of coordination, vision issues, muscle weakness, just to name a few.
In 2019 I started off on a wild pathway- I wanted to go to the Paralympics! But I could not ride a bike due to my MS. So I found the best coach: Steve Bale and we have been working together since then. Fast forward to 2024- I have now competed in 4 Paracycling World Cups and In 2023 I Represented New Zealand in the World Championships. But I have also had many setbacks and additional health challenges since then which has meant that I have to make adaptations to my life and my bike in order to continue to be mobile and to ride. But this is expensive!
In addition, Over the next year, while we are traveling for international competitions, we will be speaking at multiple International MS events about how we have learned to cope with MS.
Please help us on our next Mission: to seek out new medical care and physical adaptations, to boldly speak at MS events, and to go to the World Championship Qualifiers!

I can't see it but everyone else can. When I'm changing at a pool or places like that they often comment how 'cool' it is. It's devastating when they do.
It's really hard to move on with this constant reminder of what she did to me. So I want to be rid of it. I've found someone who will do it, it will only cost $150 but with everything else I need to rebuild my life I can't afford even that. I had to leave with just what I could carry and nowhere to go. I lived under a bridge for a month before some friends found me and got me somewhere safe to live. There are just so many things which are far more important for what little money I have.
So please help me move on. I've included a copy of the protection order I have against her so you can see my story is genuine. Thank you.

I went with him to the doctor who said it was probably just a virus even after he explained about his chest pain shortness of breath. The doctor took his heart rate it was 190 which I thought was not normal but the doctor still said was just a virus.
She did not take a blood pressure or do a proper exam just listened to his heart and lung sounds. Less then two weeks later I came home from work to find him passed away on the couch at home. My son heard my cries to come and also see what had happened. This is something we will never forget. This was the worst day of our family’s lives. The coroners finding was a Pulmonary thromboembolism, blood clot in the artery that feeds the lungs. I believe with proper treatment and tests when he first visited the doctor it could have been easily treated and he would have survived. The medical centre is currently under investigation because of his death.
We are fundraising to help pay for his funeral expenses. My wish is to also get a lawyer so no other family has to go though this. At the very least to make sure the medical centre and doctor is held accountable for what happened, the doctors need more care and attention to each and every patient to prevent this happening ever again.

I have no self confidence. I don’t go out and if I do I’m always wearing baggy tops. I can’t wear anything slightly fitted as it just looks terrible. My breast make my whole body look so much bigger.
I really want to be able to wear togs, dresses, nice tops, be able to go out and live life with confidence in myself rather than hiding away.

By October 2023 I found myself in hospital for a triple heart bypass with complications. Recovery has been slow and hard.
After slowly using my savings, i am unable to meet my tight weekly expense budget by $200 per week. I have cut my expenses as much as possible. It is hard for me to ask for help but could do with a little help.
More importantly, I have a niece and nephew in South Africa with cystic fibrosis, they are very brave and have been through a lot during their short lives. Michelle and Gus (their parents) have been very dedicated and resilient in providing them with the best care possible, however, rising medicine costs and Care have been continually getting more expensive to a point that their medical aid cannot cover them. They have already re mortgaged their home so It would be great to support them financially and make a big difference in all their lives.

We moved last year from Tauranga to live in Turangi to reduce costs of living and expenses. Turangi is about an hour away from Taupo.
Even though we have made so many changes to make a brightee future for ourselves, unfortuantely we recently found out that Josie has Stage 3 Aggressive Breast Cancer. This has since thrown our family into turmoil and is tough on everyone mentally, emotionally and financially.
After surgery and an initial start of chemo to flood the cancer cells, she will now start more chemo and radiation which varies between Taupo/Rotorua, and then Hamilton to hopefully finish the thing. With no exact end date and still months of chemo to go, things get harder every week.
As I am the sole income earner in the family, times are tough and very trying at the best of times. We are trying to get by as much as possible but are in need of some extra help.
Even though the actual cancer treatments are free - travel, accommodation, doctors, time off work, alternative treatments such as massage therapy and retreats, help, and extra expenses all add up very quickly. Especially on a sole income reduced to help the family.
Thankyou.

For my first 21km I wanted to donate to a prevalent and rising challenge in society - mental health. Most of us know people who have either faced mental health challenges, are currently facing them or maybe you know what a mental health journey feels like first hand!
I've always wanted to run 21km but have thought the goal might be too far out of reach. I started to try build up my aerobic running fitness 2 years ago and just over a year ago I ran 12km to raise money for the Starship Foundation. On the 24th of August I will be running the 1/2 marathon at Mount Maunganui.
Why Voices of Hope? Voices of Hope believe there is power in sharing your lived experience to create positive change. I agree! Through their community talks their ""why"" is creating a safe place for people who may be struggling with their mental health, to help them feel inspired, supported and empowered.
I so appreciate you supporting me with a Voices of Hope donation! To follow along on my training journey check out Refresh_Pilates

In MS the myelin sheath is attacked by the immune system leaving scarring. This damage interferes with the transmission of signals between the brain and spinal cord and other parts of the body.
Some of the symptoms of MS can include changes in sensation such as loss of sensitivity (tingling & numbness), muscle spasms, difficulty with coordination & balance, speech or swallowing problems, visual problems, fatigue, chronic pain, and bladder or bowel problems.
While there is no cure for MS as yet, ongoing research in different areas yields hope that one day a cure will be found.

Cystic Fibrosis NZ,"CFNZ is the continuous thread in the lives of people with CF and their family, walking beside them to provide support for quality of life.",https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/afe5a4a7-b3d2-46f1-851f-b10700cb6e58-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/cfanz,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/cfanz,,,0,,,"WHAT IS CYSTIC FIBROSIS?
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an invisible condition, the physical impacts are not always obvious, which can make it difficult for others to fully understand the daily struggles and limitations that individuals with CF experience.
CF is a serious, life-shortening and life-threatening genetic condition with no cure. It primarily affects the respiratory and digestive systems. Thick, sticky mucus leads to blockages in the lungs and airways, causing chronic infections, reduced lung function, and a high risk of hospitalisation. Digestive issues can include difficulties absorbing nutrients, digestive pain, bowel problems and related symptoms like nausea, headaches, and fatigue.
THE IMPACTS OF LIVING WITH CF
CF can affect all aspects of life for New Zealanders living with the condition.
It can limit the ability of the whole family unit to participate fully in other aspects of life such as work, school, social events, sports, hobbies.
Depression and anxiety from stress, trauma, isolation, fear, grief, and isolation is common.
Extended hospital stays and the burden of hours of treatment.
Medicines do help but they're not a cure and they are not always available to, or effective for, everyone. Ongoing research and advocacy are necessary to ensure future developments in treatments, and expanded access to therapies that will work for all people with CF.
ABOUT CFNZ
CFNZ was founded in 1968 by parents, for parents. We have a long history of being committed to improving the lives of those affected by CF. Our vision is that all people with CF are thriving and living healthy lives.
We deliver valuable support programmes and services to individuals with CF, their families and whānau such as emotional, financial and physical support.
CF is a condition for whole of life. Our community are in this for life, and so is CFNZ
THE IMPACT OF YOUR DONATION
Your donation really does make a difference, helping to sustain and expand the support programmes and services that address the unique needs of the CF community in New Zealand.
These resources can help individuals with CF and their families navigate the challenges they face and access the necessary tools and information for managing the condition effectively, enabling them to live well with cystic fibrosis.
CFNZ was established in 1968 and is a registered charity under the Charities Act 2005, registration number CC10274.

MS is a very misunderstood and unknown condition and we aim to raise awareness, change attitudes and work to build an environment that does not present barriers for people with chronic conditions such as MS.
MSNZ is the national voice of the MS Community standing up for the rights of those affected, liaising with allied organisations and government bodies to ensure policies concerning people with MS receive considered input from those affected.
MSNZ provides information resources to our 18 Regional Societies around the country free-of-charge to be provided to people looking for information about MS in their communities. We also provide annual training for our Field Workers, who are employed by their regional societies, across the country.
Both the cause and cure of MS are currently unknown but we exist to fund, support and promote research nationally and globally.

As Aotearoa New Zealand’s largest provider of services to under-fives, we see eight out of 10 new pēpi in their homes and in their communities. Our mahi is centred on supporting pēpi and tamariki to have the best possible start in life - they are at the heart of everything we do.
Every whānau is eligible for free Well Child Tamariki Ora (WCTO) checks. These can take place in homes or local Plunket clinics and community spaces. Nurses work alongside whānau to complete health and developmental assessments with each child to ensure they’re growing and developing as expected. These checks are critical for picking up any concerns early, so children can have the best possible start in life.
Kaiāwhina and community karitāne are trained health workers who are part of the team working alongside nurses supporting whānau in communities.
In addition to the WCTO service, Plunket also offers:
• PlunketLine – a free 24/7 parenting and child health helpline, staffed by registered nurses. PlunketLine also offers innovative video chat breastfeeding and sleep support services
• B4 School Checks through WCTO for tamariki at the age of four, prior to starting primary school
• A range of community services including playgroups, parent education, B4 School Checks, injury prevention and kaupapa Māori antenatal wānanga to support children and whānau, based on the needs of the community. These are funded through fundraising, partnerships and community grants
• A strong advocacy voice for health and wellbeing.

About Make a Wish
20 November 2008
Make-A-Wish? New Zealand has been granting wishes to children and young people since 1987. Wishes bring magic, joy and hope to these children and their families, as well as unforgettable experiences. We are the only childrenfs charity in New Zealand that focuses solely on wish granting. We canft add days to a childfs life but we can add life to a childfs day. Types of Wishes A child may wish for anything and we will do our best to make it happen. Wishes come in many shapes and sizes ? they are as varied as childrenfs imaginations! It can take some time for a child to think of their one, true wish. Children are encouraged to take their time. There are no waiting lists although sometimes a childfs medical condition may prevent the wish being granted straight away. Thatfs fine too, as their magical wish will be waiting when they get better. In general, wishes fall into four categories: To meetca favourite rock star, actor or sporting hero To beca policeman, zoo keeper or fairy princess To haveca computer, trampoline, spa pool or playhouse To gocon a family holiday in New Zealand or to Australia Wishes to go to the Gold Coast Theme Parks, or to have a new laptop are very popular, but we receive some unusual requests as well ? from a wiggles playhouse, to having a trampoline fairy tea party with an All Black or to record a song with artist Savage. Wish Process: The Wish Visit Once medical eligibility of the wish child is confirmed, two Make-A-Wish New Zealand volunteers are allocated to meet with the child or young person and their family to determine the special wish. The ewish chatf takes between 30 minutes to an hour and provides an opportunity for our dedicated volunteers to learn more about the child and their wish request. The volunteers complete a questionnaire which is returned to the wish coordinator at National Office. Making the wish happen Our hardworking wish coordination team will do whateverfs required, whether it be arranging itineraries, sourcing suppliers or sweet talking celebrity management to make every childfs dream come true. Our wonderful volunteers also get involved, using their contacts within the local community to make magic happen. As you can see, itfs a team effort! The wish presentation The magical wish is brought to life by the volunteers and wish coordinators. The volunteers put together a wish presentation that creates a magical and memorable experience for the children and their family.

September: Allergic rhinitis (hayfever) October: Eczema November: Holidaying with allergies (food allergies) We are also encouraging our members and others to hold Inside-Out Picnics in their communities.

Early Childcare and Education Staff Workshop
20 June 2014
Allergy New Zealand is hosting a Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Workshops for Early Childcare and Education Staff on the 10th of June 2014. Staff and management from early childhood services (e.g. playgroups, playcentres, kindergartens and childcare services) were invited to the event and later so were parents. The workshop was lead by a paediatric allergy/clinical immunologist from Starship Childrenfs Hospital. They provided a comprehensive overview of allergy and anaphylaxis, risk management procedures, and emergency response. Given that up to one in ten babies develop food allergy by 12 months of age. We hope to hold more for these workshops all around New Zealand for education staff as well as families as more awareness needs to be raised around food allergies etc.

Seminar for support group in Onehunga
4 April 2013
Penny Jorgensen, our CEO, held two education seminars at the Shanti Niwas Charitable Trust community support group in Onehunga. Shanti Niwas Charitable Trust, which was founded in 1994, is a non-profit organisation with a proud history of working with socially isolated senior citizens of Indian and South Asian origin living in the Auckland region. Included in the charityfs many services is the promotion of health and safety which has initiated visits from various organisations from the community. Allergy New Zealand was invited to talk on March 26 and 27, with around 100 people attending the two sessions. Project Manager, Nilima Venkant said these programmes are important as it allows people to make their own informed decisions about their health and take the information back to their extended families. She said there was a lot of interest in the topic and that the partnership with Allergy New Zealand would be ongoing. gWe already have names down of people who would like further contact with Allergy New Zealand so there may be more programmes to come.h Penny Jorgensen also said there was a positive feedback from the talk. gThese types of seminars help educate and inform a wider community about the severity of allergies. Many people came forward who either themselves had food or medicine allergies, or had grandchildren with allergies. Shanti Niwas Charitable Trust also has an elder abuse and neglect prevention service where they provide those who have been abused or neglected with support, counselling and advocacy.

Allergy New Zealand in the community
25 February 2013
Last Friday our CEO, Penny Jorgensen, gave a presentation to a group of whanua support workers and Registered Nurses involved in the Mana Kidz programme. Mana Kidz is a project with the National Hauora Coalition and Counties Manakau DHB to manage the Rheumatic Fever Prevention Programme. As part of this they are establishing health clinics in schools in the CMDHB area which is being managed by registered nurses and whanau support workers. Aside from educating them about allergies and risk management strategies, Allergy New Zealand donated 16 education kits on the day and will be donating more kits as Mana Kidz health clinics open in more schools in the south Auckland area. However, these kits could not have been donated without funding from Auckland Airportfs '12 days of Christmas', which Allergy New Zealand is very grateful for. The $120,000 was collected through the generosity of the travelling public, donating their unwanted currency into donation globes situated throughout the airport. Auckland Airport collects the money and donates it to charitable organisations on behalf of the travellers. Allergy New Zealand was one of twelve chosen charities to receive $10,000. These funds went towards putting together 50 allergy education kits for low decile schools across Auckland. The education kits are full of useful resources about allergies. Including books, cds, auto injector trainers and the Allergy & Anaphylaxis Guidelines for Early Childhood Services & Schools. If you would like to purchase an education kit for your child or local school go to www.allergy.org.nz. So far kits have gone to the following schools: Primary School Wiri Central Rongomai East Tamaki Bairds Mainfreight St Johns Sir Edmund Hillary Dawson Primary Mayfield Yendarra Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Piripono Te Kura Whakahou Ki Chapel Downs Wymondley Flatbush Intermediate Fergussen Kia Aroha Sir Edmund Hillary Have a great week, Allergy New Zealand group

Despite receiving no government funding, we aim to make all New Zealanders asthma experts, and help improve the quality of life for those who live with the condition.
The Foundation provides free resources for children and their whānau to learn about asthma, such as the interactive website Learn About Lungs, and the Sailor the Pufferfish asthma musical; but we need your help in keeping these vital services running.

Bowel Cancer NZ is a nationwide, patient-led organisation committed to reducing the impact of bowel cancer on our community through awareness, education, support, and research. Our vision is that no one will die of bowel cancer.
Bowel cancer affects 1 in 6 New Zealanders and is the second biggest cancer behind lung cancer. Despite that we receive no government funding. Statistics show that Māori or Pasifika people and other minorities develop bowel cancer earlier and face many challenges in getting early care. Also, worryingly, we are seeing a rise in the number of young people under 40 developing bowel cancer.
Interestingly, research shows that 90% of bowel cancer cases are curable with early detection and treatment. Our challenge is to encourage more kiwis to notice their symptoms earlier and to go see their doctor for further testing before it is too late. We also strongly advocate for equitable, accessible, healthcare, and earlier access to screening.
So far, we have reached 1,300,000 New Zealanders through our awareness campaigns, and over 850 patients are supported via our online support group. We have also seen a 357% increase in in home screening bowel cancer test kits, and nationwide screening due to our advocacy work.
Recently, we have collaborated with Pinc and Steele Physio, to provide free cancer specific physio rehab for people undergoing cancer treatment or recently so. The physio rehab, and another recent initiative of wellness counselling for people affected by cancer is proving to be incredibly popular and very much in demand. In addition, our new Nurse team member is there to answer questions and provide support to people in need.
Gifts we receive go towards these initiatives, as well as bowel cancer research projects, education, awareness, and advocacy for an equitable, accessible healthcare system for all New Zealanders.

It is important to understand brain injury impact the person, their family/whanau and the community.
37.7% of all traumatic brain injuries in New Zealand are due to a fall. Not everyone fully recovers after a brain injury. A mild injury does not mean mild in consequences and could prevent you from doing the things you love.
Some symptoms of a brain injury may not be evident until days or weeks after the injury. It is imperative you seek immediate medical attention and register your injury, even if you don’t lose consciousness. Early medical diagnosis and treatment improves your chances of recovery.
Brain injury can change your thinking, behaviour, mood, memory, problem solving, relationships and physical functioning.
Look after your brain – look after your life
This is what a brain injury feels like:
""Learning to live in a brain that sometimes feels like it belongs to a stranger”
""The problem is we remember who we were before the injury … and we strive to be that person over and over again even though we never will be""
You do not have to cope alone, we can help with advocacy, support and information.

Wow - we have had such great feedback after the ODT ran the front page article of Austen. Where are we at? So far Austen has got himself some new shoes which has sorted out a bit of an issue that we were having when he starts to fatigue. He was starting to clip his feet as the muscles that bring your toes up got tired (a side effect of his spinal cord injury). After the article Austen has had some good pool sessions, a run with Trev and back into the gym next week....with exams coming up its a bit of self imposed rest and starting to get the distances up. We haven't had a run together for a few weeks so we have a 10km planned for next weekend....and I am hoping to keep up this time! Thanks for all the donations to date - we have an aim to get to $5000 so every little bit helps! Thanks Mark Shirley - Physiotherapist

Prader-Willi Syndrome Association on behalf of PWS Research and PWRFA,To fund and promote PWS research and advance clinical services. (Via the Prader-Willi Research Foundation Australia www.praderwilli.org.au ),https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/a032ca9d-0146-4263-9185-b16a00d79db6-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/pwsresearch,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/pwsresearch,,,0,,,"The challenges of PWS can only be truly eliminated through research. Currently, there is no cure.
PWS is a complex, neurodevelopmental genetic disorder resulting from an abnormality of the 15th chromosome, affecting approximately 1 in 16,000 births. It causes a wide spectrum of symptoms, which include complex medical issues, developmental delays, and behavioural challenges. Individuals living with PWS also develop hyperphagia - a lack of normal hunger and satiety cues that lead to an unrelenting, intense, and uncontrollable drive to consume food. This food-seeking behaviour has the potential to create life-threatening situations, such as choking or stomach rupture if an unsupervised episode of binge eating occurs. Due to hypotonia (low muscle tone) and an altered metabolic profile, individuals living with PWS can also rapidly gain weight, reducing life expectancy because of their increased vulnerability to the health risks associated with morbid obesity. This cruel syndrome necessitates lifetime dietary restriction to remain healthy, while at the same time disregulating appetite so that those living with the syndrome may perpetually experience sensations of extreme hunger or desire to eat.
These complications mean that people living with PWS will always require support to manage their food intake and participate in food environments, imposing severe limitations on many aspects of life. There are several promising areas of research currently providing hope that some of these challenges can be alleviated or overcome, and that people living with PWS will be able to live fuller, more independent lives in the near future. With your help, PWS research has the potential to transform lives.
All funds raised through this page will go towards a PWS research project or organisation (PWRFA). If you would prefer to raise funds for the PWSA(NZ) who provides support and advocacy services for those affected by PWS in New Zealand, please see our other page on Givealittle by clicking this link: https://givealittle.co.nz/org/pwsasupport

A community where people are not afraid to disclose their epilepsy and have open conversation for fear of discrimination. Our theory of change is simple, if people understand epilepsy, then the quality of life for people living with epilepsy will improve.

Yoga on the Beach & Guest Speaker on Anxiety - Charity Event
20 April 2018
Looking for something different to do with Mum on Mothers Day? Do you have a passion for making a difference?
If this sounds like you, come along to a free charity yoga event and bring your Mum for something special to do on Mothers Day!
When: Sunday 13th May, 10:00-11:30 a.m
Where: Browns Bay Reserve
What To Bring: Yoga mat (or towel)
Why: Connect, Take Notice, Be Active, Give and Keep Learning!
For all ages and fitness levels!
Yoga Practice Run By: Barbara Fleissner
Guest Speaker: Rachael Chalmers:Registered Psychologist from Anxiety New Zealand Trust.
Rachael is a registered psychologist in New Zealand and Australia with several years of experience working with clients presenting with anxiety across all ages including, children, adolescents and adults. In particular, she works with clients of any age who are currently facing challenges with anxiety and anxiety-related disorders, depression and low mood, as well as challenges with daily life. Rachael is looking forward to giving a talk on anxiety at the event.
This event is hosted by four Massey University students who all share a common interest in addressing the issue of mental health in their community.
The Mental Health Foundation (2014), has found that anxiety rates in New Zealand women are significantly higher than in men; 7.7% of women have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives, compared to 4.4% of men.
This event has been created to raise awareness on the issue of anxiety faced by New Zealand women. We believe that an educational yoga class provides an opportunity to raise awareness, promote mental health and positively contribute to the well-being of women who are impacted by anxiety in New Zealand.
No level of experience required, just grab a spot in the sun and take in the relaxing benefits of yoga �
There will also be an amazing beauty spot prize from Skin Passion to give away ���
All donations are welcome. All fundraised proceeds will be donated to Anxiety New Zealand Trust.
Anxiety New Zealand Trust is a non-profit charity and offers treatment, support and education for anxiety and depression through a range of services for children, adolescents and adults.

So far with Givealittle donations, a grant and members' raffles we have raised $3,220.00. A sofa-bed has been ordered.

Coeliac disease is a permanent intestinal reaction to dietary gluten - a protein found in wheat, barley and rye and avenin in oats. This reaction causes damage to the small intestine and can lead to a range of symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhoea, and fatigue. If left untreated, coeliac disease can lead to serious health issues.
Coeliac NZ general manager Wendy Bremner says once coeliac disease is diagnosed, following a strict gluten free diet will improve the majority of associated problems related to malabsorption caused by the disease. Ongoing issues like alopecia, dental defects, mouth ulcers and infertility can be overcome because as the gut heals, the absorption of nutrients increases. Accessing dietary support and information to make the necessary lifestyle changes to prevent further harm, is important.
Coeliac NZ offers a variety of resources and tools to support people with coeliac disease and their whānau, including a range of videos and webinars on YouTube and a regularly published coeliac link magazine as well as our Wellness Journal with day-to-day coping tips and strategies. The organisation also runs kids’ clubs in some regions around Aotearoa.
Having the right support structures around you plays an important role enabling you to recognise life’s hurdles and gain confidence in your own ability to deal with them. For someone with coeliac disease, getting a correct diagnosis can be life changing. .
Increasing awareness of CD is instrumental in more diagnoses being made and supporting people with coeliac disease to live their best lives.
Thank you for your contribution it really makes a difference!!

Making a Difference
13 July 2023
One in 50 kiwis are Coeliac, but many remain undiagnosed!
During Coeliac Awareness Week we put the spotlight on the challenges people living with coeliac disease face. Whether you’re wanting to have the confidence to eat out safely ,a parent struggling to prepare coeliac safe food for your child at home, looking for ways to reduce your food bill with the increased cost of gluten-free foods, or struggling with the physical and psychological symptoms of the condition, the coeliac community faces a wide range of challenges on a daily basis.
Together we are stronger. Coeliac New Zealand is the voice for coeliac disease in New Zealand, by supporting us we can support early diagnosis for people with coeliac disease and provide them with solutions to ongoing challenges throughout their journey.
This time of the year can be exceptionally difficult. Navigating social occasions with family and work colleagues can be daunting for individuals with coeliac disease and you can help us raise awareness about the challenges faced.
Your donation today contributes to Coeliac New Zealand being able to continue to educate and develop resources and tools to assist individual people living with coeliac disease, those that provide health services to them and the people who cater to them.
You help us make a difference so people with coeliac disease can live their best lives.
Yours sincerely ,

Why do we need to raise awareness about Coeliac Disease
13 April 2023
It’s estimated that one in 50 Kiwis have coeliac disease, but a significant number of these cases remain undiagnosed.
“Getting a diagnosis can be life-changing,” says Coeliac NZ general manager Wendy Bremner. “That is the important first step and one that should be taken prior to starting a gluten free diet. That’s because serology testing looks for antibodies that your body produces when you eat gluten. If you are not eating gluten you will not be producing antibodies so the results will come back negative. Once people living with the condition eliminate gluten, they get a new lease on life.”
Mrs. Bremner says once coeliac disease is diagnosed, following a strict gluten free diet will improve the majority of associated problems related to malabsorption caused by the disease. Ongoing issues like alopecia, dental defects, mouth ulcers and infertility can be overcome because as the gut heals, the absorption of nutrients increases.
Thank you for your donations that help us raise awareness!!

The project is governed by the Healthy Homes Tai Tokerau Governance Group, a collaborative group of Government, health and community organisations.
This initiative retrofits insulation into high need Northland homes for free, with the aim of reducing the number of GP visits and hospital admissions for tamariki with respiratory related health conditions, addressing health inequalities and reducing health disparities for the benefit of the Northland community.
There are 1.6 million homes in New Zealand, at least 1,000,000 of which have inadequate or no insulation. Of these approximately 300,000 are occupied by people on low incomes. Many New Zealand homes are substandard for a developed country and 30% of our homes fall below World Health Organisation recommended levels.
Cold, damp homes can affect health and there is high seasonal mortality in NZ especially amongst the elderly. NZ has one of the highest asthma rates in the world.
In Northland at least 12,000 homes built before 2000 are owned by people on a ‘low income’. It is Healthy Homes’ aspirational goal that by 2020 all low income owner occupied homes built before 2000 will be retrofitted.
The free retrofit includes: Ground cover, under floor insulation, draught stopping of doors, insulating ceiling space and lagging of hot water pipes and cylinders.
So far, between April 2008 and June 2020 Healthy Homes Tai Tokerau has retrofitted 10,681 Northland homes and this number continues to grow.
More about us
Providing up to 100% Free Home Insulation for Northland, improving the health of over 10,000 Northland families & keeping heating costs down since 2008.
Significantly warmer and drier indoor living environments, Improved self-rated physical and psychological health, and for respiratory-related illness: Fewer days off school and work, Reduced hospital admissions and reduced GP visits

Currently we are only running our drop-in once a week due to costs and volunteer availability. Your donations make the world of difference to us and to the parents we are then able to support. Thank you so much for your kind donations - we really do appreciate it!

Thanks!

Green Light for PRRT!
1 October 2020
After years of lobbying (and patience) the formal announcement that interim PRRT is starting this month (September 2020) in Auckland and we couldn't be more pleased!
This is a brilliant result for patients and our NZ NET community. Getting this long-awaited treatment up and running has been a real team effort across a number of organisations, as you will see in the full press release on our website.
Unicorn Foundation NZ couldn’t be more grateful to EVERYONE involved for their mahi in bringing this to fruition. Your donation here, as little or as much as you were able to give, your support, contributions, encouragement and commitment are the reason this essential treatment option will now be available New Zealand. THANK YOU!!

Quote from ex-residents:
""My time with Moana House has been life changing in every sense. I am no longer a slave to my emotions in learning to take responsibility. I have become reliable and more at peace within myself, the community and my family are safe whenever I am around. ""I found the love that I had been searching for"""". (N.M)
""Moana House saved my life. It has opened doors that I never thought I could walk through and created endless opportunities for myself.

▪️Practical and emotional support, encouragement, and a shoulder to cry on.
▪️Information on activities and services available from ourselves and others in our Northland community in the hope that we empower New Zealanders with breast cancer to make informed choices about their treatment and care.

We offer specially trained local volunteers who have themselves been diagnosed with breast cancer. Funding helps us to provide a regularly updated Facebook page, website, and newsletter. We have fortnightly coffee/social groups to help women connect, share and feel encouraged no matter where they might be on their breast cancer journey.
Our service aims to provide resources, information and support to women diagnosed with breast cancer. We want to offer this free-of-charge to everyone who is diagnosed with breast cancer in Northland each year.  We need money to train our volunteers, provide financial help to those diagnosed, we have a meal delivery service, we host a mid-winter group meal and run an annual weekend retreat.
A breast cancer diagnosis can be an overwhelming and a life changing event. The Trust has been providing support for Northland women for over 15 years and have built strong relationships with other breast cancer services in Northland as well as local businesses.

MMNZ have established a Virtual Milk Bank throughout New Zealand, connecting donors to recipients and sharing milk safely using blood screening to test blood for viruses that can pass through the milk and asking the donors to fill out a lifestyle screening questionnaire.
We are seeking funds to assist donors with the cost of their blood tests. These tests can cost between $180-255. MMNZ have secured a discount, however the tests cost us either $100 or $150 depending on the labs we are using, which is still costly. MMNZ have recently (August) received grant funding for some areas of the country covering 1/3, the other 2/3s are unfunded. The tests need to be redone every 3 months depending on how long the donor can donate for. We are also seeking funds to assist us with our day to day admin costs, freighting milk across the country, and to support our wonderful volunteers who support our donors and recipient parents.
As well as raising awareness on the benefits that mothers milk has for babies, we aim to lobby the government to fully support donor breast milk ""as the next best thing to a mothers own milk"" (WHO) by funding the blood tests. Donor breast milk will improve the health outcomes for those who are unable to provide breast milk for their own baby's and support those who are partially feeding with their own breast milk. Ideally donor breast milk should be the first step before Formula is offered, and we believe we can make donor milk an option for all NZ babies, with enough support.
By increasing the access to breast milk the health outcomes for the nation will raise, increasing immunity at such an early age is one way. Breast Milk decreases the chance of; Obesity, Asthma, Diabetes and cardiovascular disease to name a few, and lays the foundation for a health gut microbiome. By starting off with the human specific milk, we can save ourselves $$ in the future.
More about us
MMNZ is a unique Milk Bank, we are the only organisation that freights donor milk throughout the country for the community and we assist premature babies in NICU's when requested. MMNZ assist Whanau to gain access to breast milk for their babies and aim to break down the barriers to breast milk by providing this service.

Our newest donor Karlee is a second time donor for us, we are lucky to have her extra milk. As this is Karlee's third baby she knew she would have an over supply again, so Karlee started expressing colostrum before her baby was born and carried on collecting colostrum - natures liquid gold, and transitional milk (shifting from dark orange to golden yellow moving through to creamy white) and now milk. Her milk will go to an immune-compromised baby or premature baby as her blood tests were all clear and negative.
We are so blessed to have Karlee and donors like her, that are able to set aside some time each day to express for another person in their community, the true definition of altruism.

A thank you from Mae
4 September 2021
Hi, thank you for your heartfelt message. The reason and story behind my donated milk is I always wanted to breastfeed my first born but I needed to leave PH and fly to NZ. That is the reason why, I told myself that once I will have my second child, I will work hard to breastfeed my baby and unexpectedly, I am now able to donate milk too that made my heart feel happier. This charity filled the empty spaces that I felt when I failed to breastfeed my first born. Donating milk while breastfeeding my second born feels like I am doing tandem feeding with my first born. The feeling is just over the moon and thank you for letting me donate my milk. The feeling of fulfillment is irreplaceable. Regards, Mae

Hi everyone, we do have some awesome sponsors who help us out behind the scenes.
So I would love to acknowledge Provida Foods who gave us the benefit of the doubt back when we first needed to freight milk from Auckland to Christchurch. Provida have stuck with us from the beginning and last year offered us free shipping between their depots to reduce the pressure on parents who are already often on a single income.
Thank you so much Provida Foods and your sub contractors for making this happen.

Mum Y would like to thanks us.
30 August 2019
Just wanted to say that we truly appreciate the fantastic work that you and your organisation do and hope you will pass on our deepest gratitude to the other staff and generous donors. Your help came at a key time when to my shock I discovered my milk hadn't come in as expected and despite trying everything under the sun, it sadly never did. I can't describe our level of panic when we realised my poor daughter had been deprived in her first few days of life and lost a significant amount of her birth weight. We were truly terrified as we chartered unknown waters, she being our first child, and hit that unexpected obstacle. We will be forever grateful for the fact that while formula came to the rescue initially, we were glad to know that she also had the opportunity to receive the significant benefits of breast milk also throughout her first six months of life. It truly has meant a lot to us.

Our talented scientists and PhD students are looking to better understand the fundamental causes of disfiguring conditions and life-threatening diseases such as cancer, vascular (strawberry) birthmarks, and fibrotic conditions.

On a daily basis, Raewyn manages numerous enquiries from people seeking information and advice on how they or their child can get assessed, and possibly diagnosed with ADHD. She also facilitates enquiries from people wanting help via counselling; help with challenges at their place of work, or from parents wanting to know how to navigate the education system so they can get the support that their children need at school.

Come join us in the fight against asthma. Our work literally saves lives and keeps kids safe. Day after day people come to our consults and say ""Why has no one told me this before?"" ""Why have I never been told how serious this can be?"" ""I thought I knew it all but I didn't! I have learnt so much today.""
In NZ more than 60 people die every year from asthma. But many more lives are held captive by it. help us break that ball and chain and set people free from the hold of asthma on their lives. Because no one should have to worry about their breathing.
More about us
Asthma Waikato has over 40 years of history providing education, advice and support to those suffering from respiratory conditions. The organisation was formed in January 1973 by a group of parents with children who had asthma. They wanted to support each other and others in the community who were also affected by the condition. We have grown since those early days!

From Whangārei in the north to Stewart Island in the South, seriously ill New Zealanders drive or fly hundreds of kilometres to Christchurch for treatments such as chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, heart surgery, high-risk pregnancies, neonatal care, kidney transplants, dialysis, general surgery and a host of other serious illnesses.
Medical services for these conditions are not available in their cities or rural communities. They leave their whānau, friends, farms, workplaces, and communities for days, weeks, and even months to undergo treatment at Christchurch Hospital.
We know how important it is to keep patients and their families together during what is often an incredibly stressful time. Rānui House is located opposite Christchurch Hospital and beautiful Hagley Park - we provide families an apartment with comfy beds, ample living spaces including a kitchen and laundry just like you would have at home, along with an onsite carpark and generous communal spaces. Our team is on hand to take care of the practical things giving families the time and space to focus on their treatment.

2 November 2022
Methven Care Trust has announced plans to create up to 20 new care rooms in Methven. The trust has acquired what are currently called The Crossroads Lodge and separate apartments in the centre of Methven, and will transform the two buildings into new levels of care for residents. The plan is to create up to 20 care rooms in the main Crossroads building, including spacious and en-suite options. There will also be six two-bedroomed apartments in a separate block which will be repurposed for independent retirement living.
Fundraising support to repurpose the two buildings for aged care is now being sought from private donors, businesses, community groups and regional and national grant funders. Methven Care Trust aims to have the new Methven Care complex up and running within two years. The buildings were purchased using funds raised to date, supported by the imminent sale of our Camrose Estate land, as well as a bridging loan from private donor. The intention is to repay this loan and raise additional funds to renovate and retrofit the complex.
Methven Care Trust originally planned to build in Camrose Estate on gifted land. However, rising building costs, development constraints and a lengthening timeline to complete a full build, means the Crossroads option is more viable. We welcome interest and enquiries around the project. Contact us now to determine how you can help.

Many people think of hospice services as just a building, when in fact it is a philosophy of care. It is true that most hospice services in New Zealand have inpatient facilities, but the majority of people are cared for in their homes.
Anyone living with a life limiting condition – e.g. heart failure, motor neurone disease, MS or cancer – can access and benefit from hospice services.
Our aim is to help people make the most of their lives; to live every moment in whatever way is important to them.
More about us
Hospice New Zealand is the national organisation representing all hospice services in the country.
Hospice services provide care for people with a life limiting condition whilst also supporting their family and whanau both before and after a death.

Warm thanks to all of you who have donated to Mothers Helpers - we so appreciate your support of these mothers.
Currently we are half way through a 10 week course and we would like to offer these mothers the ""Light of Hope"" candle at the completion of their course. That candle states that someone purchased it, thinking of them so that every time they light it they know that they're not alone and someone cares. This is a gift we pass on in celebration of their spending time on their recovery from postnatal depression.
The candle is $6. Would you like to sponsor a candle that can be given to one mother?

New Zealand Multiple Sclerosis Research Trust,"Our aim is to stimulate, co-ordinate and support New Zealand-based research into the cause, prevention, treatment, and cure of MS.",https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/95a0ec8f-882e-4023-8349-a4c0012b9a08-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/nzmsrt,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/nzmsrt,,,0,,,"What does the Trust do?
Collaborates with partners to fund research that helps people with MS;
Informs people about research findings;
Uses fact-based research findings to improve the lives of people with MS.
Why is the Trust needed?
A single point of focus is needed for funding MS research. In the past, research for MS has been one of only a number of research strands within organisations that deal with a wide range of neurological or other health conditions. To make a real difference to New Zealanders living with MS, MS research needs a stand-alone Trust that can initiate MS research or collaborate with research partners to fund research opportunities.
What will we do with the research?
Co-operate, collaborate and share information with other research organisations or individual researchers, within New Zealand and overseas, in the interests of advancing the research undertaken by the Trust;
Consult and share information with the MSNZ or other organisations within New Zealand representing or supporting people with MS;
Initiate, encourage and facilitate research into the application and use of clinical research outputs in establishing, supporting or maintaining practical programmes for the alleviation of the medical, psychological, physical, social, employment or other effects of MS in New Zealand;
Obtain, publish and disseminate papers, articles and other forms of information containing or reporting on research findings;
Provide research results to health professionals and their organisations with the aim of attracting, educating, and retaining high quality health professionals to work with people with MS in our hospitals and in the community;
Educate people with MS, their families, carers and members of the wider community on the outcomes of research;
Make submissions or representations to Government, health authorities or other agencies in support of legislation, regulations, funding programmes or practices designed or intended to prevent, treat, cure or alleviate the effects of MS.
Why does New Zealand need to do research?
New Zealand provides unique opportunities for MS researchers. There is so much about MS in New Zealand that is unknown. The opportunity to make life better for people with MS in our country is enormous and the need is pressing.
A strong research community underpins a strong medical and clinical workforce, and New Zealand needs to attract and retain key clinical doctors and nurses with an interest in MS.
Through its research and by strengthening international links with other MS organisations, the Trust is aiming to build a strong and respected NZ-based research capability that will make a real difference to the lives of people with MS here.
The MS Community in New Zealand strongly supports the establishment of the Trust, with MSNZ giving an initial $600,000 and the MS Auckland Region Trust giving $300,000 as founding capital for the Trust. Both organisations have indicated an intention to continue to support the Trust with additional funds as these become available.
All money raised by the trust will be professionally invested and a % of the income will be made available for approved NZ-based MS Research. The Trust is a registered charity under the Charities Act 2005 (Reg No CC51849) and donations to the Trust are eligible as deductions for tax purposes.

WHO ARE WE?
Eat For Keeps (EFK) and the N.Z Blood Sugar Foundation (NZBSF) are developing a fully integrated approach to tackling the diabetes and obesity epidemics.
EFK have helped 1,000’s of kiwi’s lose weight permanently and many of these have improved or reversed type 2 diabetic conditions. This has been achieved by focusing on blood-sugar control through ‘food and lifestyle’ skills.
THE EFK WELLNESS CHALLENGE
A cornerstone project for ‘Eat For Keeps’ and the N.Z Blood Sugar Foundation is a new and dynamic ‘Wellness Challenge’.
Combining fun, food and fitness, The ‘Eat For Keeps’ Wellness Challenge is delivered through an interactive experience, creating a platform for large communities of people to learn ‘life-saving’ health skills.
An initial pilot will be run in Tauranga in September for three months. Lessons learned from the pilot will enable the development of the free ‘National Challenge’, which will be available to all kiwis next year.
A key part of the pilot challenge is to recruit motivated people diagnosed as either pre-diabetic or diabetic. Utilising a combination of our current methods, motivational techniques and regular short bursts of exercise at their own level of ability. Based on past experience, many of the participants will either improve or reverse their condition.
WE NEED YOUR HELP!
We are now seeking support to provide funding to run the initial pilot.
By supporting this project you will be helping us to deliver a program to help fight these epidemics.
How will your support be used?
Any funds will be donated to the NZ Blood-Sugar Foundation and used for:
+ Developing and running the Challenge Website
+ Research Program
+ Resources and Prizes
Most of all, you will be part of a landmark ‘Wellness Challenge’ and potentially help 1,000’s of kiwis to improve their ‘health and life’.
NEXT STEPS
How you can help is by ‘giving a little’ and helping us to launch our pilot program.
Most of all, you will be part of a landmark ‘Wellness Challenge’ and potentially help 1,000’s of kiwis to improve their ‘health and life’.
Anyone who donates more than $50 will receive the EFK e-book for free.
Also if you’re a business, we can include your logo on the Challenge website.
Thanks for your generous and kind support.

KNOWLEDGE GAINED THROUGH RESEARCH MEANS BETTER PATIENT CARE AND IMPROVED MEDICAL TREATMENTS
AUCKLAND MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION (AMRF) EXISTS FOR ONE PURPOSE: to improve the health of New Zealanders through funding the highest quality medical research. We believe that such research is vital to making genuine advances in patient care and medical treatments. But that research comes at a cost…
GROWING A SUSTAINABLE FUND
Funding for medical research in New Zealand is critical for our future health. In 1955 a group of Auckland medical and business leaders, united in their concerns about serious shortfalls in funding for medical research, came together to form the AMRF. From small beginnings, they grew a sustainable and enduring investment fund to provide research grants every year.
OUR COMMITMENT TO FUNDING EXCELLENCE
Our Medical Committee (comprised of clinical and biomedical scientists) appraises every request for funding and will consider applications from every field of modern medicine. Only the best applications meet our rigorous standards when assessing the medical and scientific importance of new research proposals.
SUPPORTING THE BEST NEW ZEALAND RESEARCH TALENT
AMRF have supported many successful scientists in New Zealand including Prof Sir Peter Gluckman, Sir Brian Barratt-Boyes and Prof Sir Graham Liggins. Through our funding, we help to establish and retain our best emerging talent, repatriate key researchers and build capability in the New Zealand research community.
YOUR DONATION IS APPLIED ONLY TO MEDICAL RESEARCH
We apply 100% of donations, bequests, legacies and income from investments to medical research. Our operating expenses are met by a separate charitable fund.

My name is Shane Palmer and I have been traveling to Vietnam , Cambodia & Thailand for the last 12 years together with the South Australian Veterans Touring Group and have worked as their medic. The group visits a number of orphanages which they support by supplying food, educational equipment such as books, laptops and a number of other learning aids. They also have been providing financial support to purchase water filters, help with funds for transportation, supply clothing, provide funds for buildings, etc.
My primary function as a medic is to run clinics where all the adults and children can have health checks and then if needed are referred to hospital for further treatment. Examples are infections, tropical diseases, respiratory problems, dehydration, musculoskeletal disorders, trauma related problems, etc.
In the past couple of years I also started teaching First Aid and Pre-Hospital Emergency Care skills and also supply basic medicines and First Aid equipment.

I have received medals, citations and other awards for the work I have accomplished in Vietnam, St John’s and during the Christchurch Earthquakes.
Why do I continue to do this type of work?

Last year it was a half - this year we are going the FULL monty!
A small team of us are walking the 2017 Rotorua Marathon. This is an event outside of our comfort zone, but we have been training and have 6 weeks to go! It is going to take most of the day for us to complete - but what is one day for us when the lives of those touched by a metabolic disease are never the same again.
Support us to help make their lives better in a small way!

Bes is running the Christchurch half marathon at Queen's birthday
30 May 2016
Running a half marathon was something I was meant to do last year, but I had to have an operation. Thought a good motivator would be to run so I got some support for our metabolic charity - Ease The Squeeze. Supporting people and families who have an additional financial burden because of a metabolic disease. These diseases are little known and largely ignored.

I would really appreciate any ideas of how we can boost this page ...
How can we get more money for the people who need it who have been afflicted by a metabolic disease?
What else can I do???
Really hope for your ideas and suggestions - leave them on the facebook page (facebook.com/easethesqueeze)

Hi there everyone,
The word is getting out there. We are all systems go!
Give-a-little is helping. Facebook is there and the website was launched the first weekend of March!
Please can we get $5 from each of you who looks at this page? It would go so far to help these people who suffer through no fault of their own.

These are some of the poorest people in the world with the average household income of only $100 a month. KHCP also known as health care for the poor by the poor, is so effective that it is held up as an exemplar for health care in very poor countries.
Rather than coming in providing assistance and leaving, KHCP is an ongoing programme which employs former poor patients and trains them to be paramedics, mother-care experts and health care educators. The staff having been patients themselves are able to connect with the patients while at the same time providing the essential health care that they desperately need.
Many of the KHCP programmes achieve success rates equal to or better than Western hospitals. The mother-care programme (based on the NZ midwife practices put in place at KHCP by New Zealander, Libby Laing) is particularly effective, for example diseases such as measles are rarely seen due to 100% of children in the community being immunised.
How can you help?
The patients pay what they can, however being extremely poor they cannot afford to pay the full cost of treatment. It is therefore necessary to raise money for medical supplies and to cover running costs, such as staff salaries.
The annual cost of the incredible work done by KHCP is $467,000 (less than the salary of one surgeon at a Western hospital).
Here is an example of some of costs per year for just a few areas*:
• Antenatal, health and nutrition support for one mother and a child: $20
• Supervision and treatment of a diabetes patient: $70
• Average salary of one full time staff member: $1644
• 2000 (of the 47,000) general outpatients seen (includes salaries and medication): $4800
*(Statistics from 2015 KHCP annual report)
The Kailakuri Health Care Project is a NZ registered charity, and has the Health Education NGO, Mati, as its partner.
Please contribute what you can. All fundraising is done by volunteers so 100% of your donation will go to helping the poor in rural Bangladesh in an empowering way.

They are facilitated by professionals, such as cancer nurses, GP's, health professionals and counsellors all whom have many years experience.

We would so appreciate your support and donations.
The difference you can make is enormous.
Often people affected by cancer are unable to work due to treatments schedules and feeling unwell. This means price becomes a barrier to attending programmes that would really make a huge difference to their day to day lives.
By making a donation you can help us subsidise our programme fees so anyone with cancer can attend.
The feedback we receive from participants is overwhelmingly positive and life-changing.
""I believe the programme was priceless in terms of the knowledge gained.""
""It was beyond my expectations. I have found this experience life-changing and wouldn't hesitate recommending it.""
""The facilitators were outstanding, clearly very wise bringing significant knowledge to this course.""
""The facilitators were empathetic, genuine and non-judgemental, they also brought laughter and lots of smiles.""

Scleroderma NZ Inc helps support patients and families with this rare and difficult disease. There are approx 1,000 patients in New Zealand with this condition.
Scleroderma is a chronic, autoimmune, connective tissue disease. It effects patients skin, major organs like their heart, lungs, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract and their vascular system. It can be very disabling in some patients, depending on the severity.
The organs become fibrosed and unable to function properly and some people are in considerable pain.
Some patients will require home help, for many tasks around the home. All patients must keep their home environment warm during the winter, as well as keeping their core warm, to help slow progression of this disease. This comes at a considerable cost and may be very difficult for some patients if they are unable to work.
Many General Practitioners have not had experience with this disease and Scleroderma NZ aims to help promote knowledge among our medical professionals and patients, by supplying them with educational booklets and hospital checklists for special requirements.
We need help with finance for the printing of the booklets, educational speakers for seminars and meetings throughout the country and for aids like warm gloves, hats, special beds if required.
The purposes of the Scleroderma NZ are to support, friendship, education, awareness, advocacy, lobbying, prevention, research and assistance with health care for people, their families and communities with Scleroderma (Systematic Sclerosis) and Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease.

Opportunity to Purchase a New Horse
19 August 2020
Te Aroha and Districts Group Riding for the Disabled are currently hoping to purchase Tigger, a new horse which will be suitable for our program. Our target is $3,000.00. This acquisition will enable us to increase the mounts available for our riders who have differing needs. The seven existing horses and ponies do a great job with the help of our trainers and volunteers in providing goal-based riding activities that increase the ability, strength and confidence of people with physical, intellectual, emotional and social challenges. Another mount will increase our ability to do that for additional riders.

Jack has successfully had his operation. However it wasn’t a smooth journey for him. He required nearly a month on antibiotics and had to have two lots of stitches to ensure the wound healed. He is now in the mend but we need to raise a few more funds to cover the vets costs. We thank you for your support 😊

Therapy horse requires surgery ❤️
6 September 2018
Jack has been with our group for the last 5 years. He has been such an asset and is such a dedicated soul. He takes a variety of riders from those learning to ride to our wheelchair riders who are unable to hold themselves upright and need to lay down on the horse. We now need to help Jack. He has recently been diagnosed with a operable tumour. By removing the tumour this will allow him to return to the job he loves. Te Aroha vets are kindly donating their time we just need to cover the costs of the medications and antibiotics.

Hamlin Charitable Fistula Hospitals Trust NZ,Hamlin Fistula NZ exists to assist women in Ethiopia who suffer from horrific birth injuries. We train midwives & provide free surgery.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/9ee91b52-9260-4fd5-bc61-ac10010370d1-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/hamlin,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/hamlin,,,0,,,"Hamlin Fistula NZ exists to assist women in Ethiopia who suffer from horrific birth injuries.
The Trust takes its name from an unsung NZ hero Dr Reg Hamlin and his Australian wife Dr Catherine Hamlin, who together established a special hospital in Addis Ababa to treat women with fistula.
Founded over 60 years ago by the pioneering surgeons, their extraordinary journey started with an initial three-year posting to Ethiopia. Today, it reflects a lifetime quest to provide world best treatment to the most marginalised women: those who have suffered an obstetric fistula, an internal injury caused by a prolonged, unrelieved obstructed labour, which leaves them incontinent, humiliated and cut off from their communities.
Fistula sufferers are the lepers of the 21st century.
These injuries are entirely preventable. Obstetric fistulas are virtually a thing of the past in countries like New Zealand. But in rural Ethiopia, where women have little or no access to maternal healthcare, they will be in agonising labour for days if their birth is obstructed. They almost always lose their baby and suffer horrific internal damage that leaves them leaking urine, faeces, and sometimes both.
If that wasn’t traumatic enough, these women are isolated and pushed to the edge of their society – forgotten and invisible.
Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia works to mend this trauma, healing these women through surgery, rehabilitation and counselling – so they can be whole again.
For many patients, the surgery is straight-forward and after rest and recuperation, they are ready to go home. $700 provides everything needed to treat one obstetric fistula patient: good food, a nightgown and bedding, nursing care, physiotherapy, life-changing surgery, literacy and numeracy classes, a new dress and money to travel home.
Due to the stigma associated with obstetric fistula, many women cannot return to their communities and few have an income that allows them to live independently. That’s why Catherine founded Desta Mender (‘Joy Village’) in 2002 as a recovery centre where long-term fistula patients with severe injuries can continue to heal.
After 60 years the Hamlin Model of Care remains a core part of the organisation today. It is a culture instilled across the work of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia. Many of our 550 staff worked alongside Catherine over many years, even decades, and were greatly inspired by her passion and professionalism. In fact, many are also former fistula patients themselves.
The result is clinical excellence that does not compromise on treating every woman with compassion and dignity.
The Hamlin Model of Care also encompasses prevention. Hamlin midwifery students are recruited from rural areas and trained at the Hamlin College of Midwives. When they graduate they return to serve in their villages and are often the only healthcare workers for hundreds of kilometres.
In Ethiopia just 3 in 10 women have access to medical care during their pregnancy. The Hamlin midwifery program is a cornerstone of Dr Catherine Hamlin’s vision to ensure that women in Ethiopia no longer have to suffer an obstructed labour for days on end with no medical care. To date, there have been 170 graduates and in 2019 alone, Hamlin midwives delivered over 30,000 babies.
This is more than a charity that provides a handout it provides community transformation! xx

Forever.

13 June 2023
Posted by: Michael Flatman
Maia Health Foundation's current project aims to establish a purpose-built mental health outpatient facility, named Kahurangi, for children, youth, and families. The demand for Child, Adolescent, and Family (CAF) outpatient services has increased by a staggering 140% since 2018. The service receives an average of 57 emergency presentations per month, with the typical age of a referred child being 12. Unfortunately, our current outpatient facilities, primarily located at The Princess Margaret and Hillmorton Hospital sites, do not meet the standards required to provide optimal care. These facilities are old and dilapidated, leading young people to feel as though there is no concern or appreciation for their well-being. Recognising the urgent need for change, we have committed to raising $6 million toward the $13.5 million required to develop a world-class facility. To date, we have successfully raised $4.1 million towards our goal and are left with $1.9 million to secure.
We would love for you to help us reach our goal! Here is a starting point: 385 young people are being referred for acute mental health care every month. Challenge yourself to complete a physical activity related to the number 385, such as running 3.85k, cycling for 38.5 minutes, or doing 385 jumping jacks! Make your health goal a personal fundraiser, ask friends and family to donate and help us support these children and their families. Let's take steps towards better mental health together!

REACH will fund the ongoing development of the Circulating Tumor DNA project. This will provide a means for oncologists to better treat childhood cancers by ensuring ongoing treatments are well targeted and effective to improve the life of children with cancer. In turn this will reduce the need for hospital visits and also remove barriers to those who may have poor access to hospital care. REACH will increase awareness of child cancer and its effects and promote the international symbol of child cancer, which is the gold ribbon.
Donations will cover the costs for each child's sample to be researched. ctDNA sampling requires only a simple blood test and can be conducted as often as required. This provides the opportunity for more intensive surveillance and faster clinical response times, at lower cost.

Being prepared requires knowledge of the nature of these emergencies and their optimal treatments. To date there has been limited research undertaken into the many facets of emergency health care, leaving many important questions unanswered of both a medical and administrative nature.
The Emergency Care Foundation, (established in 2003), provides vital funding for research and equipment into improved accuracy and better decision making in emergency care. The Foundation relies on donations, grants and fund raising.
More about us
The Emergency Care Foundation (ECF) was established in 2003 as a charitable trust dedicated to enhancing emergency health care through research, education and innovation.
The ECF provides vital funding for diagnostic and training equipment, and research into a wide range of health issues, aiming to improve accuracy and better decision making in emergency care. It supports ongoing research into chest pain diagnosis and management, pulmonary embolism, impact of seismic events and other disasters, and a range of other issues linked to emergency care.
The ECF is proud to co-fund an Acute Care Fellow and a number of clinical staff. Results of chest pain research have impacted local care and initiated a nation-wide change of practice in how chest pain is diagnosed and managed.

Why I have started this charity?
I’ve been involved in a similar project in Australia which started 9 years ago and is still going strong. I attended the Oprah Roadshow in December 2015, and came away wanting to give back to the Community. After much thought as to what I could do, I have started this charity.
I’m a registered nurse, a wife and mother who has personally seen women struggling with life, and I’ve also been a woman in need at various stages in my life. I’ve encountered several road bumps including suffering from severe Post Natal Depression, several episodes of depression, raising a child with special needs, looking after family members with depression and suicidal episodes, dealing with the death of a best friend, and I am a survivor of sexual abuse and domestic violence. There were many days, weeks and months I struggled with life. I want women to know they are not alone and that people do care.
Just Because.
How are Just Because Pamper Packs distributed?
With the support of Schools, Community Groups and Businesses the Pamper Packs are distributed to women struggling through difficult times.

PCFNZ has a broad portfolio of in-person and remote services to assist them through the process and live their best life beyond prostate cancer, all at no cost.
These include a toll-free Information Service 0800 660 800, Online Support Forum, Counselling Service, Welfare Grants Service, Support Groups, Rainbow Blue peer support network for the GBT+ community, Prostate Cancer Patient Empowerment Programme (PC-PEP) and Prost-FIT, an exercise programme designed specifically for men living with prostate cancer.

Akaroa Hospital stood proudly on its Aylmers Valley hill site from 1926, with a view of the harbour and the sound of birdsong from nearby Garden of Tane, until the earthquakes of 2011 made it unusable. Consequently, it was demolished and only basic services were offered from makeshift premises for several years at that time.
Our Akaroa and Bays community has teamed up with Canterbury District Health Board and built an Integrated Family Health Centre in the place of the hospital. The community’s fundraising target is $3 million. This will ensure we are able to incorporate fundamental health services with aged care. Through spirited fundraising events and generous individuals we have raised over $1 million so far. Locals have dug deep however it’s a high target for a town of 700 people and sparsely populated surrounding bays. With construction complete in 2019, the countdown is still on to raise the rest of the funding for our community portion.
We are seeking your financial help for these vital services for the benefit of locals and the thousands of New Zealand and international guests that visit us annually. Our small teams of professional and volunteer services provide huge support in times of emergency, we like to see them operate safely from appropriate premises and provide for our community from infancy to older years.
We appreciate there are so many causes worthy of your support - any assistance with helping us raise the community contribution will be a terrific help.
Hopefully you’ll not require our health services, however, you’ll have made a significant difference in the lives of many.
Your donation will go directly into the account of the Akaroa Community Health Trust. The Trust is responsible for the responsible management of funds raised. $2.5 million of the funds raised will be directly contributed to the building of the facility, enabling eight aged care beds to be added to the four flexi beds and general practice. $0.5 million will be used to establish an operating company that can manage and sustain the health services most needed by our community and guests.
These facilities have proved fabulous to enable on going care for residents in an isolated area of NZ so they can be close to family and friends at traumatic times.
Medical incidents and accidents in such an isolated area need to have the facilities to care as demand dictates. This combined bay community offers many voluntary hours to assist with such call outs - helping us financially would be a terrific help.

There are 350 children born each year in the Pacific Islands who do not have immediate access to this surgery without travelling to NZ or receiving medical missions from other countries.
Repairing simple congenital heart defects is an extremely effective medical intervention. Children who would not expect to survive their childhood and who live with crippling fatigue and breathlessness are cured with one operation. They can carry on living life without the need for long term medication or follow-up.
With your help these children have the opportunity to lead an active and fulfilling life.

Hearts4Kids next Paediatric Cardiac Surgical visit to Fiji - February 2023
26 October 2022
Dear Friends and Supporters of Hearts4Kids,
After more than two years of being locked down we are finally planning our next visit to Fiji. In April 2022 a new facility was opened in Suva and is ready for use by visiting surgical teams. Our visits are now being coordinated so that Suva has regular teams travelling in to operate not only from New Zealand but also India, USA and Singapore. In future we hope that this collaboration will create a regular cardiac service not only to the children of Fiji but also those from other Pacific Islands.
Our visit dates have just been set for 22nd February through to 7th March 2023 and planning is underway to finalise the team members who can come, make lists of the supplies and equipment required, and start raising the necessary funds to meet our projected budget of $90,000. We are the most experienced of the four teams who will visit, so we have been asked by the local paediatricians to operate on some of the more complex cases, including babies with heart conditions which make them blue and children with damage from rheumatic fever who need valve repairs. In the past few years it has been difficult for Fijian children to get access to care so we are expecting there will be many with untreated heart lesions. Dr John Wright will go over in advance to liaise with the local doctors and to identify those children who will be helped by surgery.
It is very exciting to be back actually planning a trip after the long years in isolation but there will be challenges getting it organised in such a short timespan so we will have to work fast. Fundraising is a big component of this task, so if you have supported us in the past we are letting you know of this forthcoming mission, and also that we have now just reached $10,000 in recent donations. Thank you so much, we couldn't do this without your support!
With thanks, Kirsten Finucane

We facilitate a support network for families and people living with PWS, and we bring the community together through events and collaborations.
Here are some examples of how your donations can help:
* As PWS is a rare syndrome, families are geographically isolated and have little opportunity to meet. Your funds might contribute towards bringing families to a family camp, a youth weekend or a young families weekend for parents of newly diagnosed children.
* Adults living with PWS are keen to connect socially and be involved in self-advocacy and peer support projects. Your funds could help us to facilitate this.
* Your funds may enable us to offer more training courses and support workshops, or invite an expert, specialist speaker to present at a seminar.
* As times change, more is learned about PWS and new information regarding best practice and management needs to be disseminated. Your funds may contribute towards updated publications, distributed guidelines, or new library resources.

The Trust also works closely alongside other organisations that can provider longer-term support to veterans and their families in need.
The best person to assist a veteran is another veteran - someone who can understand the unique challenges faced by service personnel and their families. The general public and even people within other Veterans' support organisations often simply do not fully understand the issues that they face, or are unable to speak the unique language.
As at April 2023 No Duff has responded to 683 different situations that have included urgent and non-urgent tasks, some straightforward and some very complex (long-term and with multiple agencies involved to ensure the individuals received the required care and assistance). The scale of No Duff’s activities has increased significantly from its inception, with the number of responses to requests for assistance far exceeding original expectations.

376 Veterans Supported
27 May 2020
Money Donated will directly assist New Zealand's first-ever Veterans Peer Supporters Course.
No Duff Charitable Trust is about to launch our Veterans Peer Supporter Course. The course is a formally delivered package specifically designed to train individuals to support Veterans in crisis and will revolutionise the way we operate as an organisation, and the wider Veterans support sector.
There is an urgent requirement for better access to mental health support services across New Zealand as evidenced by the Government’s recent Mental Health Inquiry report. No Duff’s anecdotal experience over the past three years of delivering quality support services to our Veterans community has seen waiting times for professional counselling & psychological services of up to six months. In addition, the Veterans’ community in New Zealand is likely to see a significant increase in the need for peer support, counselling and other mental health support in coming years as the impact of decades of sustained operational deployments by NZDF starts to be seen.
Combined with our deep experience in delivering immediate support to veterans, a new client management software and our existing team of committed veteran volunteers, the Peer Supporter course will produce a mental health support capability unparalleled in the history of the NZ Veterans support sector, and long overdue.
Delivery of the course and ongoing supervision of Veteran Peer Supporters will be managed by a team of clinicians headed by the Trust's Clinical Advisor, Dr Paul Nealis.
No Duff Charitable Trust has the motivation, capability and capacity to develop this Peer Supporter Course which will help to train members of the Veteran’s community to be able to support one another in a safe and effective manner. It will represent a substantial change in the Veterans support landscape in NZ by providing a formalised, consistent and monitored capability that currently does not exist, and is unlikely to for some time if no action is taken.
No Duff remains committed to improving the state of the NZ Veterans support sector and continues to lead the way in doing so.

Rest Assured Respite Charitable Trust,"There are those with ME/CFS and FM in our communities, desperately needing a place to stay and be cared for, when too ill to be at home.",https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/dbb0c453-52de-423d-b96f-adbd00dda7c8-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/restassuredrespitetrust,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/restassuredrespitetrust,,,0,,,"Those with long term health conditions need a place which offers both them and their carers respite.
The ages and symptoms of those with illnesses such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Fibromyalgia (FM) mean the conventional models of care are not always the best option for them. The video on this page will explain a little more about ME/CFS and our planned respite facility, as will the videos on our website. We ask you to share our vision and this page as much as you can. By working together we will be able to create this haven - it will change and save lives. Please join us today and be a part of the team bringing this into reality as soon as is possible. Our first target is to raise $1,000,000 to provide a facility.
It is our aim to site the respite facility in the Thames area. It makes it more readily accessible to people from Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty.
ME/CFS affects men, women and all age groups - from young children and teenagers through to the elderly. It affects all ethnicities. It is believed approx. 20,000 New Zealanders have it. There was an outbreak in Tapanui which also gave it another name “Tapanui Flu”.
It's incidence peaks during adolescence and midlife.
1% of those who are diagnosed with glandular fever go on to develop ME/CFS.
There is no suitable respite for the more severe. Yet the number of those with ME/CFS is more than four times the number of those with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) for example and their symptoms equally as severe.
A recent NZ Survey showed that those with ME/CFS are in the lowest 10% for functionality. More disabled than those with living with MS, Parkinson's or Heart Disease.
Rest Assured Respite Charitable Trust is a newly formed Charity which aims to provide respite primarily but not exclusively for those with ME/CFS/FM.
It will be a place where those with ME/CFS/FM, along with similar illnesses or care needs, feel comfortable, safe and understood.
This will also provide the opportunity for carers to be trained in how best to care for those with ME/CFS/FM.
Those with the illness will be given ideas on how to manage their illness, especially if newly diagnosed. Recent biomedical research indicates an abnormal physiological response to exercise in ME/CFS patients. It's important they pace - rather than push themselves.
Other services will be available at the patient's request e.g. social worker, counsellor, chaplain, ME/CFS field worker.
There will be options for differing lengths of stay and levels of care.
Visiting speakers will give talks on relevant subjects, eg physiotherapists who understand the physiological nature of the illness, counsellors who understand the grief/loss/relational aspect and dieticians who can give practical advice.
Ideally these talks will be open to the public as well, taped and then available as a resource from an onsite library.
A recent Survey run by the Trust, opened our eyes even more to the desperate need of those in the community with ME/CFS/FM who need a place to go when they feel overwhelmed by their illness and have no one to care for them. It reminded us again that many had lost educational or career opportunities, income, partners or spouses, family members and friends because they could not understand the illness or carry the weight of caring alone .
Some had been left on their own with young children to look after. Others living on their own have difficulty getting food. They are not well enough to shop and when they do get groceries it is often canned food which is eaten cold, directly from the can. If they are too unwell they may go without food. Those who have had the illness many years are now being looked after aged parents. They worry about what will happen to them when their parents cannot look after them anymore.
Families have lost members who had ME/CFS as the patient could not find help and support and lost hope.
This place will offer help, support and hope.
More about us
Rest Assured Respite Charitable Trust has been formed to provide a respite facility for those suffering from ME/CFS & FM who need time out or care when not well enough to care for themselves.

Mid Winter Dinner
10 October 2021
We had a wonderful fundraising event in July 2021. Just before lockdown. We sold tickets for a Mid Winter Dinner and presented a fashion show, silent auction, raffles, singers, dancers and speakers. It gave us an opportunity to meet many of our supporters and share a really funfilled evening with them. We continue to find ways to raise funds as we are committed to bringing a respite facility to so many who desperately need it. Every day we are in contact with those in the community who need one now. If you would like to host a similar event or have an idea to share or would like to fundraise for us please let us know. It all takes us step by step closer to our goal. Stay safe and stay well.
To see a video of the fashion parade got to https://fb.watch/8xXPmeWtL-/ . All clothing is from our shop ""The Charity Boutique"" in Rices Mall, Howick, Auckland.

ME/CFS AWARENESS EVENT WHITFORD
30 March 2019
A huge thank you to all who came along to support our Event in Whitford. It was a chance for us to share the aim of the trust and provide some education around ME/CFS. Those who attended stayed on to talk afterwards and the feedback was very positive. Many said that it validated them and it had helped those who came with them to understand this complex condition.
We continually see the need to provide support for those who have ME/CFS. They need it urgently. Every dollar helps us to do that. Your support is vital to our success. Thank you to those who support us. A one off or regular donation, no matter how small, really helps.Together we can make a difference.
We live streamed the talks and question and answer time to The Rest Assured Respite Charitable Trust Facebook page for any who were unable to make it to the event.

Neon Challenge Marathon Wellington
18 January 2019
Our grateful thanks to Sam Fernando who ran the Neon Charity run in Wellington to raise funds for Rest Assured Respite Charitable Trust.
He ran it for his wife who has ME CFS. He found it helped him to understand the exhaustion his wife feels with her illness and the choices she has to make each day about how she uses her little energy. Sam does not have a separate Givealittle page but asked that donations be made to this page.

Our geographical area covers Waihi Beach to Paengaroa and while our focus is on Hospice at Home, we have an Inpatient Unit for short term admissions and provide Outpatient Services.
You will often hear the term palliative care which means alleviating without curing. Hospice specialises in providing palliative care – symptom control and pain management where cure is no longer an option. We also offer support services to patients and their support networks whether this be family/whanau, friends, neighbours, or staff at rest homes and hospital.
Hospice staff and volunteers care for each person as an individual and take into account the person’s physical, emotional, social, cultural and spiritual needs. In addition to palliative nursing care and specialist medical support, we provide respite care, practical support such as meal preparation, bereavement support and a chaplaincy service.
This year we expect to care for about 1000 patients and provide support services for their families.
Last year our nurses made more than 14,320 visits and over 20,000 phone calls to patients in the community.
Waipuna Hospice is not funded by government, while some of our services are contracted from the District Health Board. We need to raise $4.25 million in the coming financial year to meet the shortfall in our operating costs. That’s just under $82,000 per week!
Use of funds
Our service is free of charge to those living in our community with an illness for which cure is no longer an option. Funds raised through donations, special events, hospice shop revenue, grants and bequests help us to meet this target and we rely heavily on our community for their support. Thank you!

Cystic Fibrosis NZ - Bay of Plenty,The BOP branch of CFNZ raises funds to help with the extra costs of having CF. The branch is run by volunteers and needs help. ,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/c085be68-0fb5-43ef-a8f9-a87000a2db63-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/bopcfanz,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/bopcfanz,,,0,,,"Cystic Fibrosis is the most common inherited genetic condition in NZ. One in 25 of us carry the gene. CF affects many organs in the body, primarily the lungs and the digestive system. Thick mucus in the lungs means most people with CF do breathing exercises, combined with liquid medications taken via nebuliser treatment, twice a day. Many people with CF also struggle to put/keep on weight.
Therefore physiotherapy, exercise/sports, keeping healthy (away from bugs) and eating the CF way (high energy, high fat and lots of salt are key ingredients) are vitally important and require more effort and costs than for people without CF.
The BOP branch of CFNZ raises funds to help with the extra costs of having CF. We:
- provide new or replacement medical equipment or supporting equipment including portable nebulisers and sterilisers (with high use they are also replaced regularly)
- help costs that isn't covered by government grants, such as heating/power
- provide vouchers to help cover the additional costs associated with hospital stays (ie children in hospital have meals provided but parents who stay with them don't, and most hospital stays are 1-2 weeks)
- support the BOP costs of the national CFNZ Breath4CF grant system for people with CF
- help with education for families and health professionals, by sending people to specialized CF conferences and meetings
- cover specialist professional health or related services. For example, we raised funds to trial a community physiotherapist for our people. This trial was successful and has been picked up by the BOPDHB.
- support the national organization that raises funds, employs fieldworkers, works with health and government agencies, lobbies for better services and funding etc.
More about us
The Bay of Plenty branch of CFNZ supports those living with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) who live in the region. CF is an inherited condition that requires intensive treatment. Ongoing and progressive treatment and medical care are critical to those with CF. We help families and people with CF as there are many hidden costs to this condition - raising funds to be able to provide support is our main aim.

SST is now one of the largest mental health service providers in New Zealand. Each week, our services reach over 500 people in the Canterbury region.
SST is fortunate to receive the majority of its funding through the Canterbury District Health Board, with all services remaining free of charge. The Trust is also grateful to receive additional funding from community groups, to assist with resources and providing an additional level of service.

There are no overheads and we, as volunteers all give our time and expertise free of charge. We have a wonderful team of specialists, doctors and nurses from Starship Hospital and Christchurch Hospital who give up their holidays to work with Children's health teams in Tonga, Samoa, Fiji and more recently, Vanuatu. They provide knowledge, resources and most importantly training to assist the Pacific Paediatric teams. They continue their support with video conferencing and advise on patient treatment and care, often on an individual basis.
Prior to 2006 many children in Tonga, Samoa and Fiji were not even diagnosed with cancer and of those only a few received any treatment. We have made a difference. Now the majority of children with cancer in Tonga, Samoa and Fiji are receiving a diagnosis and an opportunity for treatment. It is now possible for the paediatric teams in these 3 nations to deliver curative treatment for some types of childhood cancers.
New Zealand children with cancer have an 83% chance of a cure. The children of the Pacific nations we support have been part of the 80% of the world's children who have only a 20% chance of cure. We support the building of capability in the Pacific to allow these figures to improve and they already have.
Yes, we are making a difference but we want to do more. We need your help! Please give generously and help us to support these children and give them the best chance of a full recovery.

Lorna asks
Kia ora,
My mother recently had a major stroke in her right side of her brain, and has been bed ridden in hospital for the last 2 & 1/2 months, she has just been discharged from hospital. Due to her immobility at this stage, we are looking for a wheelchair that will help us move her around the house for toilet, showers etc....
I found this website, just through Google.
I am hoping you can assist me with how I can help my mother get a wheelchair through this trust.
Your support is greatly appreciated.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards,
Lorna Hughes

At FACS NZ we provide support and education, whether it be on an individualised basis, or to a larger group or community; awareness of the syndromes; and seek to decrease the likelihood of these syndromes.
Foetal Anti-Convulsant Syndrome occurs when the antiepileptic medicine(s) that were taken by the mother during pregnancy cross the placenta and into the baby. The diagnosis of FACS can only be made by a specialist, when the mother, who took the specific AEDs during pregnancy has a child with a combination of physical malformations, dysmorphic (facial) features, neurodevelopment or cognitive difficulties, and no other cause can be found for these difficulties e.g., genetic syndromes.
We need your help to cover the costs of supporting families, and developing valuable resources to benefit everyone.
More about us
Foetal Anti-Convulsant Syndrome New Zealand has been set up to offer support, education, awareness and prevention advice to GPs and specialists, and families alike, about the effects of antiepileptic medicines and the effects on unborn babies. It is also a place where people, families, communities and interested parties, who have been affected by the antiepileptic medication during pregnancy, can come for support and education.

Younger Onset Dementia refers to people who experience symptoms of dementia at age 65 or younger. The person may now be over 65.
The outcomes that YODAT is seeking to deliver on are:
• That people with younger onset dementia retain a sense of belonging within their families and communities.
• That people with younger onset dementia retain appropriate levels of autonomy by having opportunities for choice and control allowing them to express and develop their own individuality.
• That people with younger onset dementia receive age appropriate therapies that encourage physical fitness, emotional expression and assist to retain self-esteem by enabling them to continue with tasks which are meaningful to them.
• That people living with younger onset dementia, their families and support people have access to advice and advocacy that will help them to deal with challenges that may arise.
Research shows that physical activity and Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (a social group intervention) improve the quality of life for people living with dementia. As one of our first initiatives we are proposing to design, implement, and evolve a Wellington-based YODAT Day Service, featuring these and other enjoyable activities which will contribute to achieving the outcomes listed above.
We are seeking funding from multiple sources to enable the establishment of this service. Once it is fully operational YODAT will assess ways in which to make the same or similar services available in other regions of New Zealand.

And there's not many people you'll meet whose family, extended family, friends or acquaintances haven't been helped by RDA somewhere along the way, or they've stepped up to help as volunteers.
Our volunteers are our mainstay - without those who give their time, we wouldn't operate - simple. Our volunteers are involved in all aspects of RDA - feeding, caring, training our horses, helping with paperwork, cleaning, and of course leading and sidewalking with our riders.
Southland RDA runs on a shoestring. We run purely on the fees charged to our riders, fees from the use of our arena, and grants we apply for. If we don't get grants, then the amount we need to charge our riders increases. This isn't fair on the riders, as their families usually have extra costs involved in the care of the rider anyway.
For this reason, we come to you and ask, can you help? Maybe you can't help out with your time, but can you spare us some change? $3 buys us a pack of bikkies so our invaluable volunteers can have something for morning tea. $8 buys us a bale of hay for our horses. $30 buys our ponies a new halter. $50 buys us another riding helmet - you get the idea, every dollar counts, and even if you can give us $1, thats $1 we don't have to go looking elsewhere for.
So, what do you say, give us a hand?

Rotary Community Breast Milk Bank Charitable Trust,Door Breast Milk: Banking on the Future Human Breast Milk is sometimes a short term gift to a mother and baby.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/8f19cb1c-6848-4dab-a37c-a90c0122e218-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/rotary-community-breast-milk-bank-charitable-trust,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/rotary-community-breast-milk-bank-charitable-trust,,,0,,,"BANKING ON THE FUTURE
Sometimes donor milk is just a short term gift to a mother and baby. This will have a significant impact on the short and long term health of babies.
Some women have challenges to establishing and maintaining their breast milk supply and many would rather use donor milk supply before infant formula.
Human Breast milk protects babies from gut, chest, ear and bladder infections because of immune factors in the milk and ongoing support for immune system development.
The funds raised go towards keeping the Rotary Community Breast Milk Bank going for the total benefit of mothers and babies in the Canterbury area. Rotary is wanting to keep this service free of charge and requires $ 30,000 per year for the pasteurisation of breast milk and associated items such as specialised blood tests for donors, donor kits, bottles, chilly bags and items associated with office administration. We are grateful to St. George's Hospital for their ongoing support in that they have given us dedicated space within the hospital to run this service.
The World Health Organisation says donor milk is the next best thing for babies after milk from baby's own mother, and the WHO suggest that human milk banks should be made available wherever possible.
Since we opened 5years ago we have helped over 2000 babies, had 90+ mothers donate their precious milk and involved over 70 volunteers. We are now open 5 days a week for 2 hours a day.
We know that there is a need for our services and we need your help to continue to grow this free service and give the mothers and babies in our region access to help them establish their milk supply.
More about us
We are officially launching the first Rotary Community Breast Milk Bank in NZ on Friday. St. George's Hospital have donated the rooms we work from at no cost. However, we have to raise $ 30,000 p/year to pay for the pasteurisation and storage of Breast Milk and to employ qualified staff to oversee the processing of this through the Neo Natal Unit and DHB. We will run this service free of charge from St. George's to all eligible Canterbury mothers and babies and it will be staffed each Wednesday from 12.30 - 2.30pm by volunteers. Some mothers, through no fault of their own, are unable to breast feed their baby but wish to be able to have access to breast milk especially in the first 6-8 weeks of life. It has been stated by the World Health Organisation that breast milk alleviates allergies, digestive problems and gut issues and has long term benefits to the overall long term health of young children.

The Horowhenua Youth Health Service offers primary care medical services to young people between the ages of 10-24 in Horowhenua and is part of the Youth-One-Stop-Shop based in Palmerston North.
A year or so ago we managed to raise some money using a Give-A-Little page to pay for orthodontic work on a young person we saw regularly at the clinic and he has just about completed his course of treatment now and is rapt with the results.
We got such great support from those who donated, and from the site, that in the end we received more than the target amount we needed. We used the extra funds to support many other young people in our area. That included paying for more dental treatment for young people who couldn’t otherwise afford it. We also used the funds to help young people with petrol vouchers and food and meal vouchers as well as to help buy them the odd birthday present and movie ticket or sometimes just a box of chocolates to say, ‘You’re awesome.’
The young people we see often carry big stories and it can take a lot to share them and giving them something to say they are awesome can be such a powerful way of saying we heard them and were moved by them. Sometimes it takes so little to make them smile.
With that in mind we’ve decided to put up another Give-A-Little page to see if we can keep on doing what we have been. We’ve been very generously supported by Angel Delivery, a meal delivery company, who have forged a partnership with us to supply some meals and treats for the young people whenever we need them to. And we’ve been looked after as well by the Levin Rotary Club, who have helped to renovate our new reception area and also donated to our fighting fund.
So if you’d like to support us as well please have a think about donating some money to our Give-A-Little page so we can continue working on these projects. It’s a very practical way of saying that we care about our young people. Anything you are able to give, no matter how small, will be greatly appreciated. We’ll try to keep you updated too as we go along so you can see how the fund is being used. Best wishes to you all and thanks again for taking a look at our page.

The New Zealand Hermitage Charitable Trust incorporated no. 268891, Charities Services Reg. no. CC.51223 promotes an alternative holistic approach to mental health issues. This is particularly with regard to, but not only, a spiritual emergency, whether it has a diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Bi-polar disorder or Depression etc.
We continue to support people in their own homes, ministering, to them according to their needs.
We aim for cures without electro shock treatment which destroys brain cells and without current psychiatric drugs and their pernicious side-effects which are often mistaken by the ignorant for a mental illness. Instead an alternative approach including the natural formula DEN is used, (Daily Essential Nutrients) which has no side effects. We aim for people to have happy, fulfilling lives reaching their full potential.
With early intervention and prevention we hope to prevent serious mental health outcomes such as suicide, incarceration, family violence, despair, homelessness, and general health impairment from the side effects of psychiatric drugs and addiction.
Hopefully we will avoid often traumatic admissions to a psychiatric institution and all that goes with it, including ECT (electro shock treatment) and pernicious side effects of psychiatric drugs.
Hopefully by following the Swedish model of Healing Homes we will avoid often traumatic admissions to a psychiatric institution and all that goes with it, including ECT (electro shock treatment) and pernicious side effects of psychiatric drugs.

The families are not chosen because they have psychiatric and psychological qualifications, but are chosen because they are compassionate, stable, loving, caring, decent people who want ""to give back to life"". The families together with the service user are supported by a psychotherapist/ psychologist. It is an enriching experience for all concerned, that is for families as well as participants.
We hope to make a Kiwi Yurt available as extra accommodation for those families who wish to participate in the project who do not have enough sleeping accommodation in their homes.
Although we are essentially a voluntary organisation, where individuals generously give of their time and expertise, we are expanding and need money for operational costs. We are also looking for natural insulation for the Kiwi Yurt.
Please help and give a little as every bit helps..
The next person who needs help could be you or a loved one. It is estimated one in six New Zealanders at sometime in their lives suffer from a mental health problem.

Emergency Assessment Fund,A Charity that helps financially disadvantaged people in the Eastern Bay of Plenty to get urgent specialist reviews.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/5b9aa2ac-1274-4cfb-b7fb-adb200f307eb-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/emergency-assessment-fund,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/emergency-assessment-fund,,,0,,,"The Emergency Assessment Fund is an Eastern Bay of Plenty charity that helps people to get the urgent medical assessments they need. In many cases people are having to wait too long for critical assessments simply because they cannot afford it.
This initiative was launched by a group of concerned medical professionals to bridge the gap between public waiting lists and specialist appointments.
So far we have helped with the following:
- 798 patients assisted with assessments and investigation
- 87 patients urgently upgraded for healthcare assistance in the public system
- 12 GPs utilised the service referring their patients for assessment
- 1,440 patients provided with surgical services
Here is one of our many case studies:
A male in his mid 50s has been having stomach pain for 18 months. GP refers and the patient is faced with a six month wait in the public system for an endoscopy. The Emergency Assessment Fund pays for a private endoscopy and esophageal cancer is confirmed. The patient is listed for urgent surgery and potential cure.

Youth in Transition is a Charitable Trust dependent on donations and is supported through the generosity of individuals, businesses and organisations within our community. We are so very grateful to our sponsors for covering the majority of our running overhead costs. It is heart-breaking that over the past few months we have had to turn away 40 young people in crisis who have reached out to us for help.
We simply do not have the resources to safely take on new clients; one of our biggest challenges is finding funding towards securing the services of experienced, registered counsellors.
It is the expertise and the experience of our dedicated counsellors, in our special and sensitive area of working with youth in crisis, that is at the core of our success.
As a priority, we would like to raise funds to employ another, desperately needed, counsellor, to enable us to meet the demand for our critical service within our community.
More about us
Every journey starts with the first step. For some, this first step is easier to take than for others. For some of us it takes a feeling of being at the end of our road, before we have the courage to ask for help with the journey back from that ‘end’.
Youth in Transition is a group of skilled, dedicated and passionate people committed to supporting any young person, their family, and close friends, on that journey – for however long it may take.
The Trust’s core service involves a programme called the “Journey Back to Awesome” which is proving to be highly successful in addressing the needs of young people who are dealing with issues such as low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Over the past three years we have helped hundreds of young people, aged 10-24, to get through their struggles and transition in to a life worth living.",,"Created by, and paying to a verified bank account of,

We rely on financial support from a number of sources to maintain our unique service in Wellington. A DHB contract provides the backbone of the funding that enables us to provide low cost counselling. We ask clients to contribute towards the cost of counselling as they can, from $10. But donations and additional funding are necessary to cover the full cost.
We counsel individuals, couples or family/whānau at centres in Newtown, Johnsonville, Porirua, Paraparaumu and in client’s homes or rest homes, if travel is difficult. In the last year we held 989 individual counselling sessions and ran 36 group sessions for 290 clients.
WellElder believes that we all face challenges as we age. We are never too old to learn new skills, change behaviour, grow in insight and understanding or maintain good emotional health. Older people are often challenged to cope with a number of significant changes, sometimes simultaneously, eg: their own reducing physical capabilities, becoming a carer for their spouse and shrinking social networks and opportunities.
Older people are used to getting on with life themselves, but a skilled professional is surprisingly easy to talk to. No issue is too big or too small – our relationships, the loss of friends and family, where we live, memories that we live with, coping with the daily demands of life, anxiety or depression – whatever it is that we face can be brought to counselling.
More about us
WellElder provides specialist community-driven counselling service for older people that is part of a proactive and protective approach to the emotional and mental good health of older people.

Chances are, when someone is first diagnosed, they would never have heard the word Scleroderma, and their Doctor may have never treated someone with this condition. They will be sent off to many specialists for tests and most likely be put on many medications. It’s a very scary time. They will feel like they are all alone in their battle and that is the reason why the Scleroderma Support and Education New Zealand Trust exists.
Scleroderma is a rare, chronic, auto-immune disease where the body attacks itself and lays down collagen as scar tissue. This can result in extreme thickening and tightening of the skin restricting movement, severe damage to the vascular system resulting in ulcers and amputations of extremities, as well as serious damage to internal organs including the lungs, heart, kidney, oesophagus, and gastrointestinal tract. Organs may become hardened, less effective and in some cases may result in organ failure. Scleroderma can range in severity from mild to life threatening. For most people living with Scleroderma, the disease has a serious impact on daily life, and although medications can sometimes help, there is no cure.
OUR PURPOSE
• To provide a supportive and educational forum for people living with scleroderma, their families and caregivers.
• To increase understanding for those who have been diagnosed with scleroderma or related auto-immune conditions, in order to enable them to better manage and live with the disease.
• To provide education, information and services about scleroderma to any person with the disease or anyone who would like to learn more.
• To facilitate support and services for those people with scleroderma and their families.
• To raise public awareness, knowledge and advance understanding of scleroderma and its symptoms, treatment and impact.
We believe through increasing knowledge we can empower people to make better informed decisions regarding their own health care.
Currently due to scleroderma being such a rare disease it can take a number of years for individuals to be diagnosed. Early diagnosis often has more favourable outcomes therefore raising awareness will assist those still undiagnosed.
We hold regular SUPPORT GROUP MEETINGS every couple of months and some of these meetings include speakers from within the medical profession and community health advocates.
If you would like further information or have been recently diagnosed feel free to CONTACT US at sclerotrust@gmail.com or to make personal contact call Ann on 021 0277 4544. We are also on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/sclerotrust
Our Trust is funded solely by donations and fundraising activities undertaken by our members. We need funding to assist with the cost of hiring speakers, to produce literature for members, caregivers and the medical profession, and to raise awareness within the wider community to assist with more timely diagnosis.

Āwhina hōiho has been established in order to create and make available equine learning and therapeutic opportunities to benefit people, whanau, communities and organisations in and around Kaitaia. It is being established as a charitable trust as there is recognition that many people in the community could not afford to pay for the services which would be provided. We work with children, youth, adults, in fact anyone who has experienced mental health limitations, addictions, trauma or are suicidal. Also people who have a desire to enhance their lives and relationships.
It has a team which includes purpose bred and handled horses and mental health and drug and alcohol qualified and skilled clinicians all working in a natural setting and providing services for koha only if people can afford that.
The Trust provides a unique service of Equine Psychotherapy and Equine Assisted Learning which is based on sound principals and Gestalt psychotherapy methods along with experiencing a natural environment.
The therapy is like counselling in an arena where the practitioner and horse provide support for the client through increasing the clients’ awareness and sharing exploration of what is happening for them with the horse. It is based on relationships, holistic practice and that change comes from acceptance and experimentation.
These opportunities will be available for individuals with therapeutic goals they want to explore, people who can benefit from social and emotional skill development and groups of people who choose to explore relationships and an enhanced quality of life or work.

Equipment- such as nebulisers, specialised physio equipment, not provided by the government heath care. Also we can contribute to a local costs of the national breath for CF grant.
Education- provide and fund education to carers, schools, young adults and possible employers, to enhance the quality of life to our community of people living with CF and minimilise the risk to their life the best we can.
What Are We Trying TO Raise?
On average it costs a minimum of $20000 per year to provide that support for people with CF and their families in our region. Members of the branch are all volunteers and accept no payment for this work. Therefore we ask for any little help via donations or anyone willing to fundraise for our cause, a little bit goes a long way to help someone breathe.
Why Do we Need Funds?
Take a moment and Breathe! How easy was that? Think about the last time you did exercise just for the fun of it or thought I do not feel like exercise today I'm just going to Chill. Think about your last Cold, you felt terrible but after a while it went away and life continued.
People living with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) have thick Sticky mucus that can block their airways and other tiny tubes to their organs. This makes is difficult to breathe and digest food, leaving them mal-nourished and difficult to maintain weigh. Exercise is a necessity to life! If a person with CF gets a cold it can mean months of antibiotic, hospital admissions and damage to the lungs that will never heal. A daily regime of Physiotherapy, exercise, multiple medications and nebulisers help to provide a quality life and keep their lungs as healthy as possible, for as long as possible. A person with Cystic Fibrosis needs a high energy, high fat, high salt intake at a much high volume than someone without CF to stay nourished enough to help fight illness an grow. There is no cure at present but in the future with research, new medicines and technology we still hope for a cure, or advances in treatment to prolong and provide quality to the life of someone living with Cystic Fibrosis.
As mentioned earlier although it is important to raise funds for research to find a cure/ quality treatment, we aim to help the Nelson Marlborough people and families with Cystic Fibrosis live for today.
As a group we plan to do some funraising events to help raise awareness and encourage support for our cause.
Thank you for you time in reading and any support given.

WHAT IF WE COULD FIND NEW WAYS TO REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF CANCER?
Almost everyone at some point will be affected by cancer in their lifetime. New Zealand has a growing and aging population, which means more people are being diagnosed with cancer.
Cancer Research Trust, a registered charity organisation, has provided over $16 million to fund bold ideas to help get cancer on the run.
Founded in 2002, the Trust funds research projects and professional development for New Zealand health professionals and researchers to help prevent, diagnose and treat all cancer types and care for people living with cancer, and ensure that New Zealanders’ management of cancer is amongst the best in the world.
We help those ideas grow through acting as an accelerator to support tin order to help reduce the impact of cancer on our families, friends and community.
100% of every dollar donated goes towards cancer related projects and training, and all projects funded by the Trust are rigorously reviewed by a panel of experts before acceptance, in order to maximise the value of those donations.
Research helps save lives - now and tomorrow.

Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection that kills one in five sufferers and causes lasting disability for survivors.
We put our funds to work to reduce sepsis harm by:
1) campaigning to increase community and hospital awareness
2) providing high quality training and clinical tools for healthcare professionals
3) supporting sepsis survivors
More about us
The NZ Sepsis Trust aims to save lives from sepsis and improve the lives of survivors. The Trust was formed when a team of doctors, nurses and quality improvement experts seeking to address deficiencies in sepsis care found that no national organization existed to bring sepsis into the public eye or to facilitate sepsis care and education.
In a country where rates of serious infection and diseases of poverty have been increasing for 20 years, we found this unacceptable and set out to create and advance a sepsis agenda for New Zealand.

We noticed a gap in the face to face support within the Hawke’s Bay community following the restructure of another organisation and decided that our young people and their families deserved to have local support on the ground when they need it.
The Acorn Project Hawke’s Bay provides individual programs of support that meets the needs of the individual member and their family, this is important as everyone’s circumstances and experiences are different.
Along with face to face Youth Worker support we also provide locally based monthly activities for our members to meet other people their age who are going through similar experiences. This encourages new friendships and peer support for our members, they can also take a break for the “cancer” for a few hours to have fun or learn a new skill that will support them in their future.
Parents and Carers have the opportunity to meet every second month to share their experiences with other parents / carers. Hearing helpful tips and ways of getting through from another person who “has been there” is incredibly empowering and valuable. They also have the chance to attend sessions facilitated by a range of professionals and agencies to make their experience easier to navigate.
The Acorn Project Hawke’s Bay is based in Hawke's Bay for the benefit of the Hawke’s Bay community.

23 May 2024
Hi everyone,
The Acorn Project is growing not only in the numbers of members we are supporting (45 individuals between Jan -mid may 24) but in the support we are offering and also the staff we have working hard, face to face, here locally in Hawke's Bay. With our increase in members this year alone we have just employed our third staff member to ensure we can provide our high level of support and individual service we pride ourselves on.
We have opened our support to children under the age of 12 with a parent/main carer diagnosed with cancer or who has passed away from cancer. They are called our Saplings and are supported separately from our older age group 12-25 yrs. We checked with other charities and organisations and nobody else was working with these children or intended to so we decided we would offer them tailored support that they needed and deserved too.
We are also running 16+ catch ups, we still have 2 camps each year for our 12-25yrs and a annual Sapling Sleepover too.
For our parents/ carers we are providing them with 1-1 support and guidance, we have a variety of parent/carer groups, which support their different needs too.
We have more ideas and plans but we need to secure more funding to do this.
All your donations are making this happen, and are helping us to grow our service and being able to continue to support our members under the age of 25 and their family living with cancer in Hawke's Bay and for that we are very grateful.

New Fund Raiser for the Acorn Project Hawkes Bay COVID hair growth prompts shave for charity challenge
12 February 2021
COVID hair growth prompts shave for charity challenge
While most Kiwis were ecstatic to get a haircut following our national COVID lockdown in 2020, Hawke’s Bay DHB Head of Finance Chris Comber was so busy getting through the daily workload he gave up on booking an appointment and decided to go a year without a haircut.
“We came out of lockdown at the end of April then all of a sudden it was August, which is when colleagues and family members started looking at me sideways and asking questions about my shaggy hair – some positive, others not so,” he quips.
“I just decided at that point it might be interesting to grow it for the remainder of the year with the intention of getting it cut in January, but then colleagues at our Christmas party suggested shaving my head for charity which I embraced straight away.”
Chris, who is a proud father to 8 year-old Harrison and 14- year-old Isobella, Husband to Debbie and a leader with Greendale/Tamatea Scout Group, says it wasn’t hard finding a charity to support.
“I wanted to do something to support children because I work with youth so much in my spare time, so I did some research and found a local charity which supports young people and their families living with cancer called The Acorn Project Hawke’s Bay.
“Acorn is essentially the local charity on the ground in Hawke’s Bay now which replaces Canteen who have moved to a digital support service.
“The aim is obviously to raise as much for The Acorn Project as possible – they are offering amazing support services to local families and I’d love to see as many people as possible get behind their great work.”
Chris’ shave the shaggy hair day will be held on Friday 26 February. (More details to come).
Fundraising Target: $5000 minimum but if $20,000 is reached, Executive Director Finance Carriann Hall has committed to getting a #1 shave on the day also!
Making a donation to the cause is easy - simply click on the Givealittle link here https://givealittle.co.nz/org/the-acorn-project
The DHB will be in regular contact with The Acorn Project Hawke’s Bay founders to update on how we’re tracking with our donation targets. Let’s get to $20,000!!

Adult Guardianship Services Trust,"AGST services empower and educate vulnerable adults through advocacy, guardianship, supported decision making and learning opportunities",https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/7a959df2-3e92-4274-aa8b-aa6500ce59d1-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/adult-guardianship-services-trust,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/adult-guardianship-services-trust,,,0,,,"'Adult Guardianship Services Trust' (AGST)came about due to there being no existing entity that supports Adults who are unable to make decisions and/or communicate decisions and therefore are vulnerable to abuse and neglect. The organisation seeks to provide advocacy support for people who have intellectual, physical and mental health disabilities to strengthen their ability to have their needs and rights met. There are no supports or services that provide advocacy and/or guardianship.
AGST provides supports and services for individuals, families and Providers to ensure the wellbeing of an Adult receiving care is first and foremost. We believe in empowering individuals to get what they need or want, through partnership and inclusion. We are purely Rights focused and act to raise the voice of a person to safeguard them from potential abuse and neglect. New Zealand does not currently have an agency in existence that acts on situations of risk for an adult who has a disability or experiences ill health. AGST works with SAFA (Safe guarding Adults from Abuse) who have recently been set up in the Auckland region. Their agency receives referrals of possible abuse and/or neglect, and AGST receives referrals to provide Advocacy, Guardianship or support with decision making, what ever is the most appropriate for the person. Many people who access both services are beneficiaries and therefore without the funds to pay for services. AGST and SAFA both have to rely on funding grants, and the generosity of New Zealanders to provide the services required.
There is also very little available to people with a learning disability in relation to training on topics such as: Self Advocacy, social skills, using a computer, using a mobile phone, life skills etc. AGST provides such training, whilst also including people with a learning disability to help host and facilitate the course content.
More about us
We provide Advocacy, Guardianship and support with decision making for Adults who (through mental, physical and intellectual disability) have difficulties making and/or communicating decisions. We also provide learning opportunities for people who have a learning disability.

We know all too well the devastation that comes with this diagnosis and the heartbreaking feeling of being overlooked.
Talk Peach are desperate to educate and break down the stigma stopping life-saving conversations.
There are major gaps in public awareness.
1 New Zealander dies every 24 hours from 1 of the 5 gynaecological cancers, that's higher than our road toll.
The survival rate for ovarian cancer sits at 37%, breast cancer used to have a similar outlook but now thanks to incredible advocacy, large scale fundraising and an immense amount of research, public support and awareness the 10 year breast cancer survival rate now sits at 92% when detected via a mammogram.
Talk Peach acknowledges and applauds the tremendous outcomes in the fight against breast cancer and believe that with similar commitment and resources we can achieve the same success for gynaecological cancers.
“In 10 years time, I don’t want to see that nothing has changed, I can’t bear to see more and more New Zealanders dying of gynaecological cancers, of something they had never heard of, never knew the signs for, or that remain so underfunded in all aspects of the disease (support, education and research). It breaks my heart over and over feeling like I got cancer that no one can talk about” -Tash Crosby Ovarian cancer survivor and Talk Peach Founder
We have to start having life-saving conversations about gynaecological health, staying silent is harming our communities. We desperately need gynaecological cancers to be funded and spoken openly about.
Our mission moving forward is to:
To provide education on gynaecological health
To educate the community on the signs and symptoms of the 5 gynaecological cancers in order to reduce late diagnosis
To provide information and support to all those diagnosed with gynaecological cancers
To support those involved with life-saving research into gynaecological cancer treatment and cures.
To advocate for better funding into: education and awareness, research, clinical trials, access to medications, and better pathways to diagnostic testing.
Please help us put gynaecological cancer in the spotlight. We don’t receive any government funding. Your support is imperative to supporting the lives of those diagnosed, educating, raising awareness and advocating for change.

5 September 2019
Mere has been in a wheelchair for 13 years (since 2006) after an abscess on her spine lead to T6 paraplegia.
In 2014 a friend invited her to a ""Smashdown Barriers"" program where she tried table tennis for the first time, and loved it! From that first day she wanted to be a champion and a year later she was travelling to Australia to play for Fiji where she defeated the Australian number 1.
Mere is an Oceania Gold Medalist for Table Tennis and also attended the Rio Paralympics and in 2016 was named Fijiian Sportswoman of the Year. She is ranked number 1 in Oceania for class 5 Table Tennis.
All of Mere's chairs over the past 13 years (there have been 3) have been standardweight chairs kindly donated by the Latter Day Saints in Utah.
Mere's current chair is far too big for her, the backrest is too high and she is unable to move her shoulders. The armrests are too high and she is unable to rest her arms comfortably. The seat is very low making it impossible for her to access some of the desks at her workplace.
The amazing thing is despite all the shortcomings with her current chair she still managed to compete and win GOLD imagine what Mere could do with a lightweight chair that fits!
Mere is an inspiration to others, showing that life is not over just because you are in a chair. She uses her sport to break down barriers and encourages others to get out and give it a go like she did.
Mere is very humble and wants to be nothing more than a great role model for others with disabilities.

Yet, we do not receive any government funding and rely on grants and donations to fund our services.
Every dollar helps us to employ a skeleton part-time team including our Manager and Registered Nurses, and engage volunteers.
We are grateful for your interest in our organisation, and assure you that any sized donation makes a difference to our work.
More about us
Established in 1985, MECFS Canterbury is a small community health and clinical service organisation providing support, advocacy and education for people living with the debilitating illness ME/CFS, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis /Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
There are an estimated 2,600 people with ME/CFS in Canterbury, with 350 of them being young people and children. This number is likely to grow as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
ME/CFS is a serious long-term illness that researchers are finding involves an abnormal physiological response to exercise, altered immune function, and impaired energy production. There is a fluctuating spectrum of symptom severity, with many people being house-bound, and the most severely affected are bed-bound.
Most people with ME/CFS are unable to work, are socially isolated, and do not have access to adequate financial, home and mobility supports through existing health and welfare systems. Many doctors are still catching up with the latest understanding of ME/CFS. This illness is long term, with no cure, no definitive diagnostic test, and limited treatment. Research shows that the quality of life for someone living with ME/CFS is the poorest of those studied.
MECFS Canterbury provides a variety of services including:
✦ In-person and online Group Support & Education Meetings for people with ME/CFS and their whānau
✦ An online Support Group that enables connections and information sharing amongst peers
✦ Our Registered Nurse Service provides individual support for: obtaining a diagnosis; symptom management; advocacy with GPs, Work and Income, and others; referrals to allied health and other external supportive services
✦ Resources, such as our regular newsletter and access to our library
✦ Education events and information for health professionals.

Cleft New Zealand was founded back in the 1970s with the aim of creating support for families on their cleft journeys. We work to bring families together to share their struggles, triumphs, and all the days in between.
Our aim is to support and empower people born with clefts to live their best lives, and to create a society that loves and accepts them. We also support the parents & families who have just had a beautiful new baby born with a cleft lip and/or palate. Coffee groups, online support groups, and an 0800 advice line are just some of the services we provide.
Going forward we are working on some new initiatives that we would appreciate you considering helping us with:
- Rewriting and updating our ""Blue Book""; a resource dedicated to information on cleft repairs, baby feeding, social issues and beyond aimed at new parents and families.
- Creating welcome packs including teddies with cleft scars to match their recipients for all new babies born (start date TBD)
- Getting ""Cleft Awareness Day"" running and creating a public profile for the charity. We hope that by educating the public, we can make the world a more inclusive place.
- Starting a library for Cleft NZ members with cleft-related literature, including picture books for kids.
- Running seminars for health care professionals to come together and discuss cleft care in NZ.

Cure Our Ovarian Cancer - NZ Purposes Fund,"Helping women with ovarian cancer live better, longer lives",https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/0195202c-f402-43fc-8816-aaab0133e602-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/ovarian-cancer,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/ovarian-cancer,,,0,,,"Help us make a difference and support our mission of ending deaths and supporting people with ovarian cancer.
Ovarian cancer is the biggest unspoken health crisis in New Zealand
It’s our least survivable women’s cancer - killing more women than our road toll. It’s disproportionately under funded, under researched and under talked about.
Your support helps us bring it out of the shadows - to diagnose women quicker, support women through the disease and ultimately find a cure.
Ovarian cancer isn’t a “one issue” problem. It requires a multi-dimensional approach. Our tools include public awareness campaigns, medical education, support groups, information guides, advocacy and research. Evidence based practice underlies everything we do.
We don’t receive any government funding. Your support is key to improving the lives of hundreds of wahine diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year.
——
Surprising facts about ovarian cancer:
It kills as many women as all of the other gynaecological cancers combined (cervical cancer is third)
Cervical screening does not detect ovarian cancer (but many people think it does)
Until 2000 the medical profession largely believed that ovarian cancer was symptomless (there was no research to support this view - a large study in 2000 showed most women experience symptoms for a prolonged time before their diagnosis)
The NZ government is currently spending billions to improve road safety. Ovarian cancer kills more women. Most years it spends nothing to reduce ovarian cancer's death toll.
According to Te Aho O Te Kahu (the Cancer Control Agency) - ovarian cancer ranks 13th (out of 13 cancers) i.e. last for research funding (yet it’s our 5th most common cause of female cancer death)
Incidence and mortality is higher in Maori and Pacific wahine
More about us
Every day one kiwi woman is diagnosed with ovarian cancer - the least survivable gynaecological cancer. As the only dedicated ovarian cancer charity in Aotearoa our mission is to give every woman with ovarian cancer improved length and quality of life.
We do this by funding transformational research, with the ultimate goal of finding a cure, raising the profile and awareness of ovarian cancer, facilitating support for women with ovarian cancer and leading change by advocating for women.

Mitey takes a school wide approach to mental health education with every part of the Mitey journey bringing teachers, staff and communities around one common goal, mentally thriving children.
Why Mitey - because research tells us if we don’t tackle mental health early, then we risk failing the next generation at the start of their lives. Primary and intermediate school is a critical time to equip children with the knowledge and skills they need to recognise and respond to mental health issues both in themselves and others before they enter the intense time of teenage years.

In 2020, after 10 years of enjoying the community's love and support, they have decided to give back to this wonderful community. They did this by creating a charity called Amber Foundation that seeks to make access to oral health care its focus. The Foundation has already established a monthly free dental treatment day in association with the practice. It is now creating a mobile dental facility to enhance access to oral health care and also help take oral health care up the remote east coast of the district.

Brain tumours can be malignant (cancer) or non-malignant (not cancer) and both can be equally life threatening. Brain cancer is different to other cancers. The brain is the most complex organ in our body, controlling almost everything we do. Brain tumours affect the very essence of who people are – their thoughts, emotions and behaviour. Brain tumours affect people physically, emotionally and cognitively. Brain tumours change people's lives dramatically.
Brain cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in children aged 19 and under - but it can literally affect people of any age.
Brain Tumour patients and their family are at the very heart of what we do.
- We provide information through our website and our patient guides.
- We put people in touch with a Support Friend who is a volunteer who has experienced what it is like to live with a brain tumour, or care for someone living with a brain tumour. They provide one to one support.
- We advocate for best treatments and care to be available for brain tumour patients here in New Zealand
We work hard to inform, support and advocate for New Zealand's brain tumour patents, their friends, family and whānau. You can find out about how we help and what we do on our website www.braintumoursupport.org.nz

Paul asks
Have you got a website?
The Epilepsy Foundation of New Zealand
Hi Paul, The Epilepsy Foundation of New Zealand transitioned in under the umbrella of the Perpetual Guardian Foundation a wee while ago, closing their independent web-site. But you can read about them on our website here:
https://www.perpetualguardian.co.nz/epilepsy-foundation/
The funds makes grants annually to organisations who are supporting Epilepsy initiatives in New Zealand, and the board members who steward these grants, are long standing advocates of the fund, and purposes of the fund.
I hope this helps, but feel free to let us know if you have any other questions, or you can e-mail us directly on: philanthropy@pgtrust.co.nz.

We extend our gratitude to everyone for their support. We are still getting feedback from our “Wellness Weeks,"" which have been made possible thanks to your generous donations.
“The Te Kiwi Māia Wellness Week came on to my radar at a time where I was at an exceptionally low point in my career and personal life. Whilst I engaged traditional pathways for support, this initiative provided a concentrated and concerted event around which hope for change could coalesce. It seemed too good to be true: a week away at a beautiful retreat with leading wellness mentors and practitioners, and the freedom to focus on oneself exclusively. The organisers created a truly unique environment: a safe, accepting, and positive space where individuals had autonomy to engage with a variety of different approaches to help their own mental wellbeing. It was a powerful emotional experience, which has left a lasting impression on me around how I support myself, and correspondingly how we support others as leaders. I’m undoubtedly better for it, and the NZDF is extremely fortunate to have access to this avenue for support.” - NZDF PERSONNEL

A massive shout out to Greg Josephs who has been busy doing a 'virtual ride' with the Tour de France. This was to motivate him on his journey with the Invictus Games and also to help fundraise for Te Kiwi Māia.
Covid didn't even stop this man! with the help from his partner who made sure he didn't push himself too much he was able to complete this challenge. Congratulations Greg, thank you for thinking of us and spreading the word of TKM.
We just checked our GiveALittle Page and see you have made around $930 for TKM.

7 July 2023
Greg Josephs you are awesome!!! Thank you so much for thinking of us and helping raise awareness of what we do while you train for the Invictus Games.
“I decided I’m not just going to get up and watch the Tour de France in the middle of the night.""
The idea of doing it came to him just the day before the race started, and he decided to also raise money for charity.
He’s asking people to pledge just one cent for every kilometre he cycles – and all of the money raised will go to Te Kiwi Māia, a charity that provides rehabilitation, recovery and respite to New Zealand’s first responders.
“When I looked at Te Kiwi Māia, I thought, ‘Wow, what an amazing charity’, because of the challenges the emergency services face - they can’t just go home and leave it behind, it’s always with them.”
The charity is especially important to him as he is a logistics officer in the New Zealand Army, and Te Kiwi Māia works very closely with the military.""

Te Kiwi Māia May 2023 update
16 May 2023
We have been relatively quiet on this Givealittle page…. but, it doesn’t mean we haven’t been busy. Since our Wellness Week last year in May, Te Kiwi Māia ran another programme in September 2022 for 12 first responders and NZDF personnel.
We were able to create opportunities for rest and recreation, psychoeducation regarding mental health and wellbeing, provide our audience with the tools and skills required for building resilience, and for managing stress and burnout. This also provided a safe and inclusive space for strengthening social and peer support networks.
We have had great results from the programmes that we run, and those that attended last year cannot speak highly enough of our course. A huge thank you goes to the team who worked tirelessly on creating our programme. Louise Morgan from Massey University, Rajna Bogdanovic from First Response Health, Lady Joanne Shelford, and our other incredible specialists. To the first responders/NZDF personnel who attended the programme – thank you for trusting us, and helping us shape the future of wellness in New Zealand.
This year we are hoping to run another three programmes, where we can offer our help and support to more first responders and NZDF personnel in need. We are incredibly fortunate to have Wardie, who competed in this year's Celebrity Treasure Island, and won $10,000 for TKM. Also, to the Firefighters who fundraised another $10,000 from their golf competition this year in Taupō. This has set us up with a good amount of funds in the account, which we need to build on (and, if you would like to donate to the next Wellness Week or help in any way, please share the link to our Givealittle page).
“The timing of this retreat could not have come at a better time for me after having a staff member take his own life 2 weeks before the course started, which was extremely challenging for me having to attend the scene and then manage and care for my team who attended their colleague. This has to be the best course I have done in my career. I didn't realise how close I have been to burnout (I think I was actually burnout 18 months ago) and how I wasn't managing my stress, and also how the way I was never letting go of work was affecting myself and my family in a very negative way. Everyone of your team had a massive impact on me, as well as the others on the course, and I don't say this lightly. It has changed my life for the better. The content was on point and exactly what we needed... what you are doing is essential and needed by First Responders in NZ, and is an absolute game changer in my opinion” - Leader’s Retreat, St John
Thank you to all who have helped share Te Kiwi Māia’s vision, and those who have supported us, and helped spread the word. We set up Te Kiwi Māia because we could see a massive gap in first responder/NZDF care, and we are forever grateful to those who are standing with us, and helping us make a difference and move forward in wellness.

So pleased to see such significant benefits arising with the help of our support.
Wellness Week May 2022
2 June 2022
We have been planning for the past year our first wellness retreat where we take away some of our First Responders and NZDF personnel. With lots of help and advice from specialists, support from the organisations and fundraising we were able to take a group of 12 away last week to a gorgeous location for some much needed support and time out.
We are so thankful and blessed to these amazing people who look after us daily, and to be able to look after them is why we set up in the first place. Thank you St John, Fire and Emergency and the Royal New Zealand Navy for trusting us with your people.
Thank you also to our Give-a-Little supporters for your kind donations. We were able to put your funds towards this retreat, and we hope to be able to run another one before the end of the year.
To our Te Kiwi Māia Pioneers - thank you for leading the way, embracing the week and helping shape the support and services we will provide into the future. It is an honour to have you as part of our Te Kiwi Māia Family.
""For me this week was a godsend. I have been struggling like many others with maintaining positive mental wellbeing due to work stressors and have more recently been suffering the effects of burnout. This got me to a point where a month ago I couldn’t see how I could continue to be any part of this organisation without it destroying me or my family and was resigned to the fact that I would have to leave the organisation.
Attending the Te Kiwi Māia programme has had a truly profound effect on my physical and mental wellbeing that is hard to put into words.
I am now more positive towards change, feel more in control of my emotions and actions, more connected to loved ones, more resilient to trauma, more accepting of differences, a greater sense of self worth, and have had a huge improvement in my overall wellbeing.
I feel the happiest and healthiest I have been in a long time which has definitely been noticed by workmates and more importantly my whanau.
But best of all the week has taught me the warning signs when my wellbeing is regressing and effective tools and processes that with practice will help keep me well for years to come. "" - TKM PIONEER

May Update
23 May 2021
Just like that we are already in May!
We started the year off with a bang and were part of 'SeePort – Ports of Auckland' where we teamed up with the New Zealand Defence Force. Meeting crowds of thousands, we introduced them to who Te Kiwi Māia is and sold our cool merchandise. We were located in a side opening container, which we decked out with our merch, house plants and Harry & Larry (our Tactical Solutions models). Our favourite part was our photo wall where we had a variety of NZDF and first responder uniforms for children to dress up in.
In March we held our second wellness workshop with our affiliated organisations, returning to the stunning Huntly House. It was great to have everyone back with some new faces involved as well (Auckland Rescue Helicopter joined us this time!). We were able to have an informative debrief about how each of the organisations are faring and where Te Kiwi Māia can focus our energy to assist. We had the talented Navy Chef Dani Swart helping to feed the troops, and were surprised by a quick pop in from the one and only Buck Shelford! We will be having another two more workshops this year.
October this year will be the first ever ‘Armed Forces & Emergency Services Bodybuilding and Fitness Competition' where we are the chosen charity. Funds from the competition will be going towards Te Kiwi Māia, as well as money raised by individual competitors via personal Give-a-Little pages. We are really looking forward to supporting this event and watching everyone compete.
Our T-Shirts are selling well and we recently released our pin and a wrist band, which you can purchase on our website.
Thank you so much for all of your support for our people and their families. This year is going to be a big one for Te Kiwi Māia and you can expect to see and hear more from us in the media, raising awareness of why we have been established and what we hope to achieve in the future.

Is there an event you've been involved in that you will always remember?
19 February 2021
We filmed Rebekah from St John and Barry from Fire and Emergency NZ back in June 2020 along with Josh (St John) and Cherie (NZ Army). We asked them all types of questions and this one was a tough one.
We are very grateful to them for opening up to us and being so honest. Our first responders do so much to keep us safe and this goes to show they never forget.
Thank you to all our first responders and NZDF personal for the job you do everyday!

Merry Christmas
20 December 2020
Dear Friends and Supporters,
As we all start to wind down for Christmas, we just want to take a moment to say a huge thank you for your support over the past year. Whether you brought a t-shirt, shared our Facebook page, donated to us, or talked about our cause to friends and family, we are so incredibly grateful for your support.
Even though it has been a challenging year, we were excited to achieve a big milestone by holding our first ""Wellness Workshop"" with our organisations’ wellness experts. We have some big plans for 2021 and will make sure we keep you updated.
We hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and take some time to rest, recharge and enjoy our amazing kiwi summer.
A very special thank you to those who are working through the holiday period, doing an incredible job to look after us and protect us - we appreciate you all! The below quote really resonates with us, we understand the sacrifices you make and the challenges you face at this time of year.
""This is going to be a tough week for first responders. This week we will respond to car wrecks filled with bodies and Christmas gifts, we will respond to cardiac arrests during family dinners, we will respond to suicides for the people where this isn't the happiest time of year. We will respond to drug overdoses, murders and sexual assaults......and when our shift is over we'll return to our families, act like none of it happened and try to enjoy the holiday season. Let's stick together this week everyone and be safe. "" - DanSun

Wellness Workshop
23 November 2020
On the 9th/10th November we held our very first wellness workshop! We were very fortunate to utilise Huntly House as our stunning venue for this two day event.
The purpose of this workshop was to bring wellness representatives together from across the various organisations in a unique opportunity to collaborate, share their knowledge/experience, find out what others are doing well and where they might be facing similar challenges.
It was also a great opportunity for us to share our vision for Te Kiwi Māia and allow them to provide some guidance on the areas they see us being able to add the greatest value.
This would not have been possible if it wasn't for all your kind donations. We really appreciate
your support and help to spread the word of Te Kiwi Māia.
Thank you to all who attended and for your outstanding contribution and making this an incredibly successful event.

TKM Video - What do the public not release you go through everyday?
26 September 2020
Earlier this year we caught up with some amazing first responders & NZDF personnel for a Q&A session. Some of the questions were pretty tough and the answers were open, honest and raw.
This week is Mental Health Awareness Week, so we are going to share some short video clips on the topic, featuring their stories, hearing about some of the challenges they face in their role and also finding out what techniques work well for them.
Today's video features Barry from FENZ and Josh from St John discussing dealing with a traumatic incident.
Thank you to the orgnisations for you support and to Barry and Josh for being apart of this. To Huntly house for sharing your beautiful home and to Fraser at 10,000 Dreams for filming.

T-shirt pre-sale
8 July 2020
We are just too excited to wait any longer! We have decided to take pre-sales on our awesome new TKM t-shirt.
We reached out to the very talented artist Renee Thyne, who also happens to work full time in the Royal New Zealand Air Force. We gave her our brief and she came up with this beautiful design.
""My idea for the design was to promote mental wellness. The helmets represent the heads of our responders and the heart not only represents the health of those personnel but the support of the person wearing the shirt.” - Renee Thyne
Help us spread the word - tell all your family and friends! All profits go to TKM in support of our first responders and NZDF personnel.

Thanks to everyone involved for making this happen and to our wonderful models from the RNZN.

Ventilated Kids Trust,Support long term ventilated children to live in the community.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/ca8ada8b-ce21-432f-8d80-ac0900129817-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/ventilated-kids-trust,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/ventilated-kids-trust,,,0,,,"We are a relatively new charitable organisation (September 2015) created to support the integration of children on long term breathing support (ventilators) back into the community. These children usually have a variety of other needs and complex issues such as paralysis, wheel chairs, communication issues, life support equipment and require modified housing and carers in the home. Reintegrating them back into the community is a difficult process through the current health system, which is not well structured to deal with the processes involved.
Most children on ventilators are only supported in Intensive Care Units (ICU) which is the hospital’s most expensive area. The only paediatric ICU in New Zealand is at Starship Children’s Health, with an average daily cost (per child) of $5000, over $1.8 million per annum.
Long-term hospitalisation is inappropriate for a developing child, it puts them at risk of hospital acquired infection, is expensive, is detrimental to family functioning and relationships, is an unnecessary use of resources and blocks intensive care and medical specialty beds for other ill children, impacting the whole community nationally.
There are obvious advantages to all concerned, when care is transitioned to a community home based model. However, the variety of Government agencies, departments and district health boards involved, creates obstacles to successfully and quickly enable exiting from the hospital and moving these children home.
Our objective is to help facilitate the process of moving children to a home care environment. This will significantly reduce the burden on the health system, releasing approximately $4 million for other medical needs and free desperately needed Starship ICU beds.
There are high demands on charitable funds and this may appear to only benefit a small section of the community, however, if viewed from a wider perspective, there are significant benefits for children nationally. Freeing up significant health funding for children, needed space in the country’s only children’s hospital and reducing surgical delays with more available beds in ICU. Therefore, we would appreciate your consideration and would be thankful for any assistance you can provide.

This invaluable opportunity brings family and friends together to enjoy quality time, the chance to connect and create special memories that last a lifetime.
TimeOut Charity gives people an opportunity to temporarily escape the psychological and emotional challenges that accompany this diagnosis. It gives them to take a much-needed break and allow a lot of the stresses and pressures to be put aside for a short time. Families are strengthened by knowing others care about them enough to give them some practical help and support. Often a lot of the support offered at this time is medical and directed at the person with the illness. TimeOut Charity centers on the entire family
As a nationwide charity, TimeOut provides holiday home owners all around NZ the opportunity to give back and support our vulnerable community members in a unique and personal way. Sharing their good fortune and special place with these families is a very rewarding experience.
Our vision is to offer a TimeOut stay to as many families dealing with terminal illness as possible.
We are incredibly fortunate that the majority of our TimeOut stay costs are generously donated by our holiday home owners. We have been able to facilitate these stays mainly through volunteer assistance to date, however to keep up with existing demand and to reach our growth objectives we now urgently require financial support.
All funds generated will go directly into funding the administration necessary to facilitate TimeOut stays (processing applications, coordinating stays, managing holiday home database) as well as driving overall growth and development (growing holiday home database, building relationships with patient referring organisations, increasing fundraising via events, sponsorships, grants etc).
We are so incredibly grateful for all donations and support.

Overall, we operate across three main areas, the two main areas are funded by grants, donations and fundraising:
1. The vast majority of our work involves social support and advocacy for our clients and their families.
2. The balance of our services involves our Service Support staff who arrange gym, pool and other exercise classes to be delivered, under contract, by specialist providers. Attendees make a small contribution towards the cost of these classes.
3. We are also a local information resource about MS and the impact on individuals and our community and a resource for our clients about new developments in treatment. This part of our work is funded through a contract our National Office has with the Ministry of Health.
Our Lead Fieldworker service is delivered under a social work model and “scope of practice”. Health and disability aspects of MS are dealt with separately by the health and disability agencies whom we liaise with, while we concentrate on the social complications associated with the condition.
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disorder which can have a devastating effect on people’s lives. New Zealand has a high, and rising, prevalence of MS. It is usually diagnosed in young adulthood, affecting people during their ‘productive’ years – when working and raising families. Fatigue affects 75-90% of people with MS and, along with digestive system, eyesight and muscular problems, can be a very disabling complication. Fatigue in MS is not remediable with medication.
More about us
We are a non-profit organisation formed to provide ongoing support, education and advocacy for people with Multiple Sclerosis. It also aims to educate the general public, employers and health professionals about these diseases.

COVID-19 is a historical class global emergency of which most of the world is at high risk because there is not enough medical equipment or medical professionals to use it. rapid response requirements to variable needs. The world remains in danger until a vaccine is developed, passes all its tests, is manufactured, distributed worldwide and administered twice within an affordable budget. This will take until at least late next year.
For those who are unlucky, a percentage are going to need oxygen and ventilators. A large number of countries are not adequately equipped with either medical professionals or equipment to support those infected and save their lives.
Healthcare workers are tired and overwhelmed by fighting this novel disease.
- low affordability and availability of oxygen and ventilators
- rapidly emerging hotspots
- gradually overwhelmed medical facilities
- new and little understood disease leading to poor treatment protocols
Solution
Many throughout the world have it within their power to help those who are at risk which will in turn reduce the overall viral load until everyone can benefit from a vaccine. Doctors and other medical professionals who become overwhelmed will be supported by our ventilator and oxygen equipment which can be operated from anywhere in the world.
- latest technology producing cost-effective solutions
- volunteer prepayments enable rapid delivery of the loan equipment
- software to help doctors and maximize their time
- data analysis to support science to improve treatment protocols globally
Impact
You have the opportunity to join this global battle and help us out so that we can build the equipment that doctors need to save lives.
US$ 5 can pay for internet traffic, cloud computing costs and data storage
US$ 10 can deliver a ventilator to any place in the world
US$ 25 can be used to deliver, repair and operate the equipment for one patient
US$ 300 can pay for all the parts of a ventilator
US$ 5000-10000 will equip a rural village clinic
More about us
We aim to produce vast numbers of sophisticated ventilators, at the lowest cost, in the most effective way. Our group of volunteers are developing, assembling, and testing every day to achieve this goal.

Head & Neck Cancer Support Charitable Trust,We would love your help to sustain our charitable giving for this forgotten cancer group.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/f26ac73d-dc54-482b-a47c-b117013916d1-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/head-and-neck-cancer-support-charitable-trust,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/head-and-neck-cancer-support-charitable-trust,,,0,,,"Head and neck cancer is a truly horrible disease: painful treatment, disfigurement, loss of voice, no social eating, expensive dental work down the track and little recognition by society. Because of some fabulous treatments by our medical services, many of us are patched up almost good as new again but the mental, physical and financial strains remain.
We already give peer support to fellow head and neckers and we all love the supportive community we have created.
However, as we have grown from a Facebook group into a Charitable Trust, we want to help patients better. We have raised funds for patient packs consisting of a tote bag containing items a new patient might need to more expensive goods that might be a great importance to some families.
Our first major items at this level have been blenders for soft food eaters and dry mouth products like Oral 7.
Next on the list will be travel items like petrol vouchers, taxi and Uber credit and parking vouchers. We need to raise money for this and so in the months surrounding World Head and Neck Cancer Day (July 27) we will fundraise as much as we can.
How patients felt at diagnosis
“Shock. Half of my mouth was going to be removed.”
“But my kids are too young to lose their mum.”
“Thoughts of disfigurement filled my mind”.
“Shock and fear of the unknown.”
“Would my appearance scare my granddaughter?
“Maybe death would be a better option?”
“There was a 50/50 chance I wouldn’t be around in five years.”
“The ever-present difficulty of communicating with the world. It is very isolating.”
“A sense of self-disgust. Over half my tongue was going to be cut out.”

14 February 2024
The Head & Neck Cancer Support Aotearoa Charitable Trust is relatively new and was set up in 2020 just as the pandemic hit. It is also the only head and neck cancer support charity in New Zealand. Unlike breast, prostate, bowel and blood cancers, head and neck cancer awareness and funding goes pretty much under the radar. Because of this we are overlooked when it comes to financial support and our charity was set up to do our best to fill that gap and need. To date we have been operating on private donations from fellow patients together with their family and friends. Donors help us to offer practical support to some of our most vulnerable patients who might have little or no financial or emotional support.
We started providing patient packs for all new patients attending Multi-Disciplinary Meetings (MDMs) at Auckland Hospital back in 2020 as a trial and then branched out to Dunedin and Waikato and have recently added Christchurch and Hutt Hospitals as well.
Our goal is to continue extending our reach so that every patient in New Zealand attending an MDM will receive the pack and know right from the start, that as daunting and impossible that their treatment will seem, we are there to help with (and understand) the fear and anxiety that they are going to be experiencing.

Patient Pack Fundraiser for World Head and Neck Cancer Day
25 July 2022
This Wednesday, the 27th of July 2022, is World Head and Neck Cancer Day.
Head and neck cancer patients remember the day when they were given their diagnosis. Just thinking about it now, five years later still affects me.
So many people in the head and neck cancer comminity have wanted to make a difference and make sure that other people never go through what we have and also want to help educate people about this cancer so that they can at least pick it up early, or even better still, prevent it.
For this reason, a charity was set up by some of the members in the HNCSA Facebook group in 2020. One of the aims is to try and find ways to help newly diagnosed people to let them know that they were not alone and there were people out there who had been through it and survived and thrived.
It is not an easy road as we all know and there are times when it can be traumatic.
One of the things that the funds from the charity covers is making and putting together patient packs to be given to new patients at their Multi-Disciplinary Meeting. This includes a tote bag for the enormous amounts of paper work and information we are given on this day, plus a notebook and pen to write down all the information we are given (or as much as our shocked brains can process), plus being able to write down questions that we think of as they arise. Each answer to a question seems to raise even more questions. We also include a brochure letting them know about our lovely group of people plus a lip balm as the hospital climate can be pretty hot and dry.
Each pack costs approximately $10 and current numbers of head and neck patients attending Multi-Disciplinary meetings nationwide is sitting at around 1000 per year.
We are asking if people would be prepared to support one new patient by donating $10 for World Head and Neck Cancer Day. If you want to support more new patients then that is absolutely fine as well! Feel free to give as much or as little as you are comfortable with as it all counts and makes a huge difference.

We are starting to make a difference
8 April 2021
Hi to all our lovely people.
Many of you have generously donated to our Givealittle Page with the funds going to our new charity.
Our charity has many goals with one of them being able to support our fellow head and neck cancer patients who are experiencing a high level of financial hardship. We all know that any cancer can cause financial strain but we somehow muddle along. We have been made aware though that there are a number of patients who genuinely can not afford the petrol to get to treatments and follow-up consultations, and they opt out of treatment as they can not afford to take the time off work.
This is something that with help from our group and the wider community, we can change. As we have all experienced, our circumstances can change in an instant. I can not imagine what it would be like to have to forgo treatments as you couldn't afford to stop working as your family would not survive without your income.
As a charity, we have also been raising awareness of support services such as our FB support group and want to continue to improve the experience for new patients. This has been able to be achieved through the funds people have so kindly donated and here is what we have done with some of these funds so far. We have been printing bags with our logo on them to give new patients at their MDM so they can put all their info into it. We all remember how many pieces of paper flashed before our eyes in our dazed conditions! Secondly is some lip balm sticks to put into these packs as well as to give to people on the wards. And last but not least are 10 brand new blenders for people who are going to need to blend their food but can not afford to purchase this vital piece of equipment to aid their recovery. Our clinical nurse specialist, speech and swallowing therapist, and dietician will collectively decide which of their patients has the most urgent need of them.

Raising awareness and supporting patients and whanau
28 January 2021
Many thanks to all the people who have donated so far. We have five charitable aims: to support people, raise awareness, provide some financial aid, run meetings and provide information. All of these aims have running costs and one thing we can do is to save lives by making people aware of the warning signs of head and neck cancer and of prevention measures that can be taken.

Thank you to our supporters
28 December 2020
It has been gratifying to receive donations from people in what has been a difficult year. We are very grateful. As we enter the new year we have organised a planning day to set up specific targets for funding, for example to provide blenders to head and neck cancer patients who can't eat solid food after treatment and are unable to afford an effective blender for soft food.

Being able to leave the baby downstairs with loving, caring and capable caregivers and attend the group upstairs in a peaceful and welcoming environment was exactly what I needed to prioritize my own health and wellbeing again.
The group is different from other mum groups, as it puts the mum first, and not the children (though we spend lots of time talking about them too ^^)
It gave me tools and power to 'calm the storm' in my head to see the beautiful parts of motherhood again and gave me a positive outlook into my journey as a mum but also being myself.
I would recommend this group to ALL mums, struggling or not.
We all need this kind of support in our life ♡”.

We are a community charity.
People are supported to live as well as possible and to allow death to occur naturally with comfort and dignity. Throughout this time and in their bereavement, we also support family and whānau.
Hospice care is holistic. It extends beyond physical needs, placing equal importance on emotional, social, cultural and spiritual needs and wants. This care extends to family and whānau caring for you.
Most people receive our services primarily, or even entirely, at home or in their place of residence; wherever that is throughout the entire Whangarei District or south-east Kaipara. Most people only come to our premises Te Whare Hūmārie in Tikipunga, Whangārei if they need a closer level of monitoring or symptoms cannot be managed at home. Sometimes family and whānau or other carers may need some respite and people stay for a short period of time until they are ready to return home.
Our hospice services are provided free of charge.
However, the gap between the partial Government funding we receive and the actual cost to provide the service we do is approximately $2.8 million every year. This is the amount we need to fundraise annually, which works out to $55,000 every week and almost $8,000 per day.
Every dollar that is raised for North Haven Hospice, stays here in our community, supporting local people facing the end of life and during bereavement.
More about us
Specialist palliative care for people of any age and with any life-limiting condition, and support for their families/whanau. There is no charge for our service, available to anyone of any age who lives in the Whangarei District or south-east Kaipara.

With this consistency of income, students are able to focus on their studies until graduation.
Medic to Medic links student health workers in Malawi and Uganda to international donors. In this way, we function along the lines of “sponsor a child” schemes run by well-known charities. Of note, although we link individual students, we pool our donations so that even if a donor withdraws, no student is disadvantaged. At first, these donors were mostly health professionals (hence “Medic to Medic”), but now include many members of the public as well.
Our students send their linked sponsor regular updates on their progress. This can then develop into a correspondence if the donor so wishes. We hope this will not only provide mentoring advice for students, but will also raise awareness of the conditions facing medical colleagues worldwide.
We cover each students tuition fees and other necessary allowances as well as providing them with medical equipment and textbooks so that they have everything they need to reach their FULL potential and successfully qualify as health workers in their home country. We currently support over 60 students.
Medic to Medic has expanded from sponsoring only medical students to sponsoring a whole range of trainee health professionals, from one country to three and from one university to seven.

The Osteopathic Children’s Foundation Charitable Trust (“OCF”) has been set up by a passionate group of people who want more children to have access to osteopathy in New Zealand. Cost is one of the key impediments to children having access to osteopathy and OCF’s great ambition is to overcome this obstacle. Our key focus is:
- To provide free osteopathic services for children;
- to fund research, teaching, fellowship support and other educational activities for the purpose of promoting and improving (free) osteopathic and other ancillary or complementary health services for children;
- to purchase equipment and other services or products for hospitals and other healthcare organisations charged with the delivery of free osteopathic health services for children.
Why are we doing this?
Why are we doing this? Because every child deserves better health and osteopathy helps children in so many ways. The idea that children are young and flexible and don’t have musculoskeletal imbalances in their body is a myth. In virtually every condition there is a mechanical component which contributes, either as a cause or a consequence, to physical and physiological problems. Osteopathy is the science of identifying these factors and assisting the body in adjusting to them. It is not an alternative to medical treatment, it can be complementary to the mainstream healthcare approach. Osteopathy is holistic, gentle and safe.
What are we up to?
Our first project is to mobilise a group of experienced practitioners and run a monthly koha clinic for the community based at a marae in Hamilton East. We aim to serve lower socio-economic groups through this health centre.
We are raising money to supply equipment and services to make this the best possible healthcare for the children including tables, examination equipment and toys. The osteopaths and board are donating their time for free.
About us
Every child deserves better health.
Use of funds
The money raised will go to running a centre where children can access free world class osteopathic healthcare and helping more children access the treatment they need.
Osteopaths will be giving their time for free.

Dementia is an umbrella term for a group of neurological conditions that affect the brain causing progressive deterioration in memory, thinking and behaviour. There are over 100 conditions that may cause dementia – Alzheimer’s disease being the most common.

Right now, Dementia Wellington receives on average 100 referrals a month from the local community in Kāpiti, Porirua, Wellington and the Hutt Valley. Dementia Wellington receives approximately 44% of income from local District Health Board contracts, the remainder from people like you, or local groups, and through grant applications and trusts.
Community volunteers are always welcome.

(1) by developing custom programmes for our clients, they regain control over their recovery and wellbeing; and
(2) by coming to the gym alongside other cancer survivors, they become part of an incredibly strong community, supporting each other no matter what life brings.
Previously run at the University of Otago for 12 years, we are establishing The Wellness Gym Otago in the community. Our Dunedin Hub is now open, and we will run more outreach programmes across the Otago region.

This unmet need is borne most heavily by people who can’t afford the cost of private hospital care or health insurance. Most end up putting up with their problems, with their condition often impairing their ability to work, exercise, maintain relationships, or remain independence, and a likely impact on their mental health.
OUR SERVICES The hospital will provide free elective day surgery and outpatient clinics including for those in the Wellington Region community. Services are continually changing to meet the needs of the community and the changing capacities of the public health system. This requires ongoing monitoring of referral patterns and regular communication with the public system and staff.
VOLUNTARY MEDICAL SERVICES All clinical services will be provided voluntarily by surgeons, anaesthetists, specialists medical and nursing staff from across the Wellington Region for free. We are hugely motivated by receiving offers of support from more than 40 medical specialists in Wellington willing to volunteer their time and expertise to help fellow citizens in need.

The purpose is to create a charitable hospital that provides free specialist services for the people of the Wellington region who are ineligible for such care from the existing public health institutions and are unable to afford private medical care.

We raise funds for preemie related causes and are looking forward to raising some much needed funds for NICU's and organisations across the country.
PKC was founded by me (Courtney), I was born premature over 30 years ago and spent the first four months of my life in the NICU at National Womens Hospital in Auckland.
My parents made sure that I understood from a young age how life changing the support of the Doctors, Nurses and Support Staff are for preemies and their families. I've always wanted to give back and help the NICU since they helped her family and her so much.
Over the last six years, PKC has collected thousands of knitted items from our community of knitters and donated knitted items to a wide range of hospitals, NICU's and preemie related organisations across both New Zealand and Australia.
In addition, we have donated money to assist in the development of hospital facilities for premature babies. In 2022, we raised enough funds to donate a whanau bed to the SCBU in Waitakere and specialist chairs to the NICU at Christchurch Hospital. We have also donated funds to the Well Foundation and Middlemore Foundation over the years.
I am so grateful for the support and love hearing all the stories about other people's personal connections to the NICU so please get in touch if you have a question or you’d like more information.

We want to bring hope and possibilities into someone’s life, who is struggling with the impact of having an abortion. Please check out www.buttonsproject.org for more info.

How will it help:
● To facilitate post abortion recovery programmes and online support.
● To create a memorial with the physical buttons in a respectful manner and a place for people to visit.
● To help with admin and normal running costs. For example - web host, printing, phone, stationary, petrol.

After his diagnosis in 2018, Blair was told he had weeks to live, but chronic under-resourcing of the health service in Southland meant he was unlikely to see a specialist before cancer took his life. Blair decided that this health inequity needed to change. As a result, one of his greatest legacies was the formation of the Southland Charity Hospital. The hospital project has been underway for three years. Construction is currently underway and is expected to be completed by late 2022.
The Southland Charity Hospital does not receive any government funding. The project has been entirely funded by the community, with people donating time, materials, skills and money. Once completed the hospital will service patients throughout Otago and Southland.

We do this by partnering with agencies, volunteer groups, and specialist legal advice, to assess, object, and represent communities in the licensing process.
The Alcohol licensing process has become increasingly legalistic and bureaucratic, and the Alcohol industry invests in specialist advice and legal representation to ensure outcomes that suit its agenda. What this means is that communities who wish to exercise their right to oppose new alcohol outlets, or get restrictions placed on hours, or even just have a say in the process, are often under-resourced, or lack the specialist knowledge to object to new licenses effectively.
Communities Against Alcohol Harm partners with communities, local boards, health authorities and others to provide the specialised advice necessary to successfully oppose new licenses, or amend license conditions. We do this by working with specialists in the area of alcohol licensing.
Currently Communities Against Alcohol Harm can only work in limited locations, as our resources are stretched. We want to help more communities who want to have a say in the amenities of their communities', but we can only stretch our limited resources, and our time, so far.
But we need help; we need tools for our volunteers, we need to cover the costs associated with running a small organisation, and most of all, we need help paying for specialist legal assistance.

This is the most aggressive type of brain cancer.
In the days following diagnosis, so many of our thoughts were focused on providing Tahu and his whānau (his wife Jo and their children) with the support that they needed but we didn’t know what or how we could most practically do this.
THF was created out of multiple needs: Those of Tahu and Jo, their son Knox and their second son Manaaki (at that time, unborn), and that of their close whānau and friends to show their love and support for the Hikuroa’s as they faced their toughest battle together.
Along the way, we came to the realisation that there is a huge gap in support provided to brain tumour patients in New Zealand and so with Tahu’s blessing, we have opened our support up to others that have found themselves impacted by a brain tumour diagnosis.
Tahu passed away on the 4th of September 2020, 3.5 years after his diagnosis but we continue his legacy by supporting others with a brain tumour diagnosis.

We are a support organisation for brain tumour patients and their whānau. We provide practical support in various formats and we advocate for research in brain tumours and brain cancer.

“I was astonished at the level of the need there. I saw children with conditions such as cataract whose eyesight was in desperate need of appropriate attention.”

As a registered charity, we are committed to providing low or no cost care for high needs and vulnerable whānau, with a focus on reducing the inequities in access to primary care and health outcomes for our highest need patients in Wairau, particularly our Māori whānau.
Our kaupapa Māori model of care is different - with fewer patients per GP, we have longer appointments, more time for patient advocacy, and shorter wait times for appointments. Our team focuses on holistic, whānau-centred care, addressing all aspects of hauora / wellbeing.
Most importantly, our whare is a welcome haven, where whānau with complex care needs can come without the burden of having to pay. During our first 12 months of operation (from August 2021), 55% of all our appointments were free for patients.
As a result, our service has higher costs and lower income, so runs at a loss - we are dependent on funding to cover this loss and keep providing the quality care we are known for.
""Manu Ora"" refers to the bird taking flight having achieved hauora. It encompasses our mission to provide a holistic approach that embraces and provides more fully for our Wairau community.

Mā te huruhuru, ka rere to manu
Me whakahoki mai te mana ki te whānau, hapū, iwi.

We provide a safe space for men to come together and talk through the challenges they face in life. Our peer-to-peer support services are a great way to drive connection with real life experiences being shared, whether its in person at our Barbershop Chats, or via our online community, we strive to provide a space that works for all.
On average we lose 800,000 people to suicide each year globally, 80% of those people are men, meaning we lose on average 640,000 men each year. That's at least one man for every minute, of every hour of every day!
Sadly here in NZ these statistics are similar, with 75% of all suicides being men, and suicide being the leading cause of death for men under the age of 45.
We are doing all we can to try and change this narrative and remove the social stigma attached to men's mental health in NZ, but we can't do it alone, we need your help!
All donations help with funding our peer support services, with a portion of funds being withheld to assist vulnerable men with therapy costs, where financially they are unable to usually attend.
Every $ helps make a difference and every $ is greatly appreciated!

Today the charity has many facets - Kauri Lodge Rest Home, The Pā Wellness Centre, Te Ara Pae Ora Community Centre, Teaching Gardens, and a rural Wellness Outreach team. We run free programmes and services that support healthy living and resilience in the rohe.
Kauri Lodge is a 25-bed residential care home that offers our whānau a quiet and friendly environment. Nestled in the hills and surrounded by pasture and native bush, residents enjoy a lovely view and easy visiting options for far north families.
At Whangaroa Health Services we have three main focuses:
- Improve access to health services.

From the story I learned that while the therapy had great results, it was very expensive and not funded by every NZ DHB. Expensive monitoring and expensive to buy the nutritious high fat foods
Our NZ expert gave an example in the story, explaining how one child reduced seizures from 60 per day to 30 after 7 days of MKT. To effect change on Epilepsy the target for children is as a high as 90:10 (Fat:Protein+Carbs).
So… What to do? Well, four things.
The 1st is to raise money. The 2nd is to invest the money so that it pays for ongoing help for NZ families whose kids need MKT. The 3rd is to raise awareness about the benefits of MKT and the cost savings it can present to our health system. And the 4th is to look at other causes I can bring under the same “Raise:Invest:Do Good” approach.
In Feb 2023 I restructured the charity so other causes could be helped via DRFX. The first is HEAT which will help families in the Wairarapa get access to dry firewood. Saving money each month for it to be doubled in value in firewood for Winter. Donations will help pay for firewood processing or buying it in for distribution.
I will run half marathons and get sponsored. Come and join me, or sponsor me, or donate or all, everything helps. Please tag donations as DRFXMKT or DRFXHEAT or DRFXBOTH
More about us
The treatment of epilepsy in children with Ketogenic therapies can be very successful, but is costly and time-consuming requiring 24/7/365 monitoring, the Trust purpose is to assist families gain access to Medicalised Ketogenic Therapies.

It has been a while since I have done one of these. I have done a video which explains what has been happening, what I am training for now and what I am raising money for. The link to YouTube will be included with this email.
Thank you for your support. If you see my posts on Linked In or Facebook, please do like and share.
All the best.

Austin McDowell Foundation,Developing the Austin Assessment screening tool to identify the child in every class struggling due to cerebral visual impairment.,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/bccbd980-1696-4d4c-872c-af9500be083f-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/austin-mcdowell-foundation,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/austin-mcdowell-foundation,,,0,,,"Right now, children in every class in every school are struggling due to unknown, undiagnosed, unsupported visual difficulties caused by cerebral visual impairment or CVI. The children are lost in these classes; they all have the potential to learn and develop much more effectively, but only if they get the support they need. To get support, the children first need to be identified.
Dr Nicola McDowell was one of those kids. She knows first-hand the difference support makes. Nicola’s life is dedicated to reaching and helping children like her and she has developed an iPad App called the Austin Assessment, to do just that. The App is a simple fun game of matching cards, with built in measures to identify children. Through extensive published research, the App has been validated meaning it is accurate.
Nicola has set up the Austin McDowell Foundation to develop and run the App. The team at the Foundation are all contributing their time at no cost but need to raise funds to get the App into production. How many children? From research, in New Zealand, around 35,000 children are struggling because of CVI. In Australia 180,000, the UK nearly half a million, the US over 2 million.
We need to raise NZ$650k for the App and website which will provide the all-important support information for the children identified. Please help reach these children by donating.
News story on the App: https://www.1news.co.nz/2023/01/06/kiwi-develops-app-to-detect-common-visual-impairment-in-kids/

The Austin McDowell Foundation has been set up to support the Austin Assessment App, a screening tool for cerebral visual impairment related visual issues. The aim of the Austin McDowell Foundation is to ensure equitable access to the Austin Assessment.

The lives of those affected are turned upside down. Pain levels are unimagnably high and constant, to the point where even the lightest touch to skin results in extreme distress. A diagnosis of Complex Regional Pain syndrome is a scary and confusing. A quick web-search will show horror story after horror story about CRPS.
Kiwi CRPS Trust, a registered charity, provides a positive force to support those affected by CRPS, to raise awareness, advocate, collect information and support research efforts, all of which requires infrastructure and funding.
What is CRPS?
Complex Regional Pain Syndrome is, as its name suggests, complex!
This is the simplest explanation: CRPS is continuing pain, well out of proportion to the severity and normal time frame of the event that caused the initial pain. As well as pain it involves sensory, autonomic, motor and/or tropic symptoms.
More about us
Kiwi CRPS Trust is a New Zealand run charity providing support, awareness, friendship and education for those in New Zealand who are living with or have loved ones with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. We collaborate with researchers and health organisations to continuously raise awareness.

15 February 2024
Our Safe Gains pilot in 2023 was a beautiful success. Every week we had eager kiritaki showing up to move their bodies, learn and connect with others. We were able to get out of the gym on many occasions to try different types of movement including bouldering, circus skills and trail-walking.
Some of the feedback we got from last year:
""This is the first fitness class where I've felt truly safe""
""I actually want a exercise and move my body now""
“I have met cool people I never would have met before""
“I have learned how to lift and move in ways I love""
We are very excited to keep developing and growing this program in 2024. Thanks for supporting this awesome mahi!

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia,Empowerment of patients to advocate for and gain access to world-class treatments for CLL,https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/3c297ac3-ef9e-4f93-975d-afd201296c6a-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/org/chronic-lymphocytic-leukaemia,,,,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/org/chronic-lymphocytic-leukaemia,,,0,,,"A number of New Zealanders with CLL are alive and well today because they’ve been able to access life-saving therapies. They’ve survived either through good fortune (compassionate access programmes or clinical trials) or because they were able to pay for treatment themselves. They are enjoying fulfilling and productive lives. Others have not been so fortunate. CLL Advocates NZ exists to draw attention to and address this fundamental inequity.
We are a very small group of individuals affected by CLL and medical specialists active in the treatment of CLL, who want to:
• empower patients to advocate for and gain access to world-class treatments for CLL
• build public knowledge and understanding of the potential of modern CLL therapies to transform and save lives
• encourage the development of NZ guidelines to ensure equitable access to best practice treatment for all CLL patients, irrespective of geographic, ethnic, or socio-economic differences
• promote and support NZ-based research on CLL, including the value and importance of developing and participating in clinical trials, and improving the quality of NZ data on CLL
• build awareness of accessibility and funding models in use in comparable countries, and
• form connections internationally with other CLL patient groups and advocates
More about us
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) is a type of blood cancer that occurs when your body makes too many abnormal white blood cells. Leukaemia develops when cancerous white blood cells develop in the bone marrow and invade the circulating blood.

ACC estimates that up to 35,000 people suffer from a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year in New Zealand
30% more people than are diagnosed with cancer
Only two thirds receive treatment
Infants, children and adolescents are at greater risk of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) than any other age groups
TBI is a leading cause of long-term disability among children and young adults in Canterbury
Māori and Pacific people are over-represented in TBI statistics
How we help
There’s no one-size fits all response when it comes to diagnosis or treatment.
The effects are different for everyone and can be cognitive, behavioural, emotional, and physical; they can inhibit a person’s ability to live independently, maintain relationships and return to work or education and participate in leisure activities.

• By request, we sing in a small group (three to four singers) at the bedside of individual patients. We visit patients wherever they are – at home, in a hospice, hospital or rest home. Our request sings vary greatly depending on circumstances. Every sing is unique, just like the person we're singing for. We might sing just one or two songs, or we might sing for quite a while. The songs can be soothing or uplifting, depending on the needs of the patient, family and caregivers.
• At regular scheduled visits to rest homes, hospitals and hospices, we sing at bedsides and in public spaces (lounges, reception rooms and sometimes corridors). The number of singers might be 8-10 for these regular visits.
It isn’t necessary to applaud or even acknowledge that we're there, we don't require introductions or thanks. We’re trained to be sensitive to the needs of those present, and respond accordingly.
Our service is delivered without charge to patients or their families. Our singers are all volunteers and they meet their own travel and other personal expenses. We’re a charitable organisation and our organisational expenses are funded through donations, grants and fundraising events.
More about us
Whakaahuru - The Gentle Singers. (Whakaahuru means to warm, or nestle, or to cherish).
The Whakaahuru Singers were formed in 2014 to sing at the bedside of people who are receiving palliative care or otherwise approaching the end of life. This may include those living in their own homes, hospice, hospital or residential care. The service will be delivered without charge to patients or their families.
To be at the bedside at the end of life is an honour that gives a sense of the forces that bind us all. Our desire is to be there with a gift to ease the journey - please help us to achieve this.

Officer Sarah was an emblem of courage for her town. Yet, beneath the badge, the weight of traumatic incidents, fears, and daily stresses began to erode her spirit. Nights became restless, and memories from duty often haunted her days. She felt isolated, fearing that her vulnerabilities would be perceived as weakness.
That's when the Foundation stepped in.
Upon learning about Sarah's struggles, we quickly connected her with specialists who understood the unique challenges faced by police personnel. Through tailored programmes, she met others, realising she wasn't alone. Our resources gave her children insights into their mother's world, aiding their understanding and emotional well-being.
The Foundation's vision of Zero suicide struck a chord. Sarah knew many colleagues faced the same silent battles. Today, rejuvenated, Sarah has become a beacon for others, dismantling the barriers of silence.
Your contribution ensures that many more like Sarah find hope and support. Let's stand by our nation's bravest, ensuring a resilient and robust police force.

Hapai Taumaha Hapūtanga - Crisis Pregnancy Support is a health professional-based service in the wider Wellington region in Aotearoa, New Zealand. We offer free, confidential, and both emotionally and practically grounded care for women who find themselves unexpectedly pregnant or need support in their pregnancies. Also, we offer support for pregnancy loss including abortion grief.
The essence of our name which was gifted to us by iwi, Hapai Taumaha Hapūtanga, resonates
deeply with our mission:
Hapai - to carry
Taumaha - to be heavy or burdened
Hapūtanga – pregnancy
We understand that at times, pregnancy can feel heavy or like a burden. Our aim is to share that load with women and help carry some of that weight, working hand in hand to help women navigate through what can be a stressful time.
As health professionals, we use our skills to partner with women and their whanau, assessing current challenges and helping to meet unmet needs. We empower, advocate and offer support to help in the areas that have been identified.
Please see our website www.crisispregnancysupport.org.nz for further information.

""It's like getting on a treadmill of health care""
Four years of surgeries followed, all meant to reduce the chance that she get breast or ovarian cancer. Sadly for Kate and her family, she was diagnosed with breast cancer last year, and the pace of the treadmill increased, as she moved into chemotherapy and radiation. The journey for her whanau has been traumatic, and her children want to know if they carry the gene, if they have to go through the same treatment, what to expect, and where to get support.

It is a broad term that includes things like getting together with others, having others we can rely on for support, or feeling that we belong and are valued. We can experience these different types of social connection with family and friends, in our workplaces and neighborhoods, or as members of a group or club.
Human beings evolved to be social as a way of surviving, and social connection continues to be vital to our health and wellbeing. If we lack social connection, or if the contact we do have with others is not meeting our emotional needs, it affects our physical and mental health. Just as hunger or thirst are signals that we need to find food or water, feeling lonely is a sign that we need to care for ourselves by seeking more social connection.

These programs aim to reduce isolation among older people and strengthen communities through increasing participation and engagement. They are available to those 65 and over living independently.

Our men are dying. This year around 650 New Zealanders will commit suicide, roughly 500 of those will be male.
One in eight Kiwi men will experience serious depression during their lifetime, the rates of loneliness and poor mental wellbeing are rising, health professionals are overrun.
So, what's the solution?
Community.
BetterMan is a charity on a mission to help men become better versions of themselves.
Let's be honest - most men aren't good at talking about their struggles, so our formula to tackle that is BYC - Betterment, Yarns, Competition.
Betterment: As former athletes we're taking the best parts of team sport and combining it with our positive psychology knowledge to help men grow and thrive.
Yarns: We're starting discussions on some of the topics men have avoided for so long. By being open and honest about our own struggles we're giving permission for other men to do the same.
Competition: We get men in the door to our events with fun, games and competition to build camaraderie, connection and a community.
WE NEED YOUR HELP. YES, YOU.
You can help us on our mission by:
1. Donating directly to our cause.
2. Be a ""Man on a Mission"" or ""Woman on a Mission"" yourself. What have you always wanted to achieve? Climb a mountain? Eat a biscuit the size of a small dog? Whatever it is, you can help us by creating your own mission and donating the proceeds to BetterMan.
So, will you answer the call and help us to help the men of Aotearoa?

I am taking the Plunge for Mental Health,"Fundraising for Gumboot Friday, I will take the plunge competing in a diving competition to raise funds for better access to counseling",https://static.givealittle.co.nz/assets/hero/7eec3543-a345-46fd-afec-b19300d90b55-320:False,https://givealittle.co.nz/fundraiser/i-am-taking-the-plunge-for-mental-health,0.0,0.0,75 days to go,Donate,https://givealittle.co.nz/donate/fundraiser/i-am-taking-the-plunge-for-mental-health,21 Jun 2024,17 Sep 2024,0,Auckland,,"A couple of years ago I suffered a traumatic brain injury and multi-trauma body injuries following an accident with my horse. It wasn't only my physical, but also my mental health that suffered tremendously.
About a year after my accident, sparked by my specialist asking me for my goals, I started springboard diving to build up strength and get active.
“I’m what I call a true rehab diver.”
With the support from my fellow divers, I faced my fear and tried a 3 m dive – the first of what is now nearly 4000 off the 3 m board.
I am still experiencing fear when standing on the board before jumping, but push through by thinking of our wonderful community and the amazing feeling diving provides.
Without the support of my family and diving whānau, as well as access to counselling it would've been much harder to navigate my journey of healing.
I am also pushing myself for my beautiful 2 young people, to whom counselling has been a lifeline.
This time I am going to push myself and am setting the following personal diving challenges:
At $500 raised, I will do a somersault off the 1m
At $750 raised, I will do a lineup (head first) from the 7.5m platform
At $1000 I will be forever grateful to you all!!
(scary... I don't do somersaults or anything higher than 5m...)",,"Created by

On September 28th, I’ll be running the entire Christchurch 360 Trail, a route that symbolizes a complete approach needed for true mental well-being.
Why I’m Doing This
Mental health is a cause that is incredibly important. I’ve experienced & witnessed the impact that mental health challenges can have on individuals and their loved ones. Through this run, I aim to emphasize the importance of physical activity in improving mental health and to promote a full-circle ""360"" approach that addresses all aspects of life.
What It’s About
The 360 Trail Run for Mental Health is more than just a physical challenge. Physical activity is a powerful tool that can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, improve mood, and enhance overall mental health. This run is a symbol of the journey towards holistic well-being, encouraging everyone to take steps towards better mental health.
How You Can Help
Your support can make a significant difference. By donating to this cause, you’ll be helping to fund and support services that the ""I am Hope Foundation"" provide to those in need. Every contribution, no matter the size, will help make a positive impact in our community.
Join me in this journey and help promote well-being. Together, we can support those facing mental health challenges and make a difference.

I'm tentatively getting back into running after a long hiatus so what better way to keep up the motivation than running for my favourite charity. I may be a bit biased since I'm one of the co-founders, but I'm incredibly proud of the work we've done over the past 2 years. We're still entirely volunteer-run, so fundraising and donations are like gold, and it means we can continue to give a voice to the 753,000 people with migraine.
Please support my efforts to start pounding the pavements again. You'll be supporting an amazing cause and truly making a difference!",,"Created by
